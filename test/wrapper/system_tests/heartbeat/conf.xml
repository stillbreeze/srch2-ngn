		Fields
		Required
		 
		Fields we want to search on in addition to the primary key.
	     
		"name" : is the name of the field
		"type" : is the type of the field. Supported types are:
		    - Text
		    - location_longtitude (For Geo search)
		    - location_latitude (For Geo search)
		    - integer
		    - float
		    - time
		     
		"indexed" : If you want to search on a field, indexed should be true. A field can only be used for sort, filtering 
					and facet if its 'indexed' property is false. If you need a field to be used in keyword search AND also
					for sort,filter and facet, you should include two instances of the field one with indexed="true" (for
					keyword search) and one with indexed="false" (for sort and facet). 
		"default" : The default value which is used if this field is empty.
		"required": The flag which indicates whether this field can be empty or not. It is false by default.
		 
		Note:
		    - If you want to have geo search, you should have two fields with the types of ocation_latitude and location_longtitude.
		    Make sure to set both latitude and longitude.
		    - The values of these geo fields should be float in the JSON (input) file.
		    - Primary key is optional to be included here. It can be included here to set its indexed property to true.
		    Type is always text for primary key, it is required and there is no need for default value. If primary key is included
		    here and indexed="false" it will be also used for sort,filtering and facet.
