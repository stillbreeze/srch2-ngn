If you merely want to check that the first line has no lower-case letters, check that explicitly, e.g.\\n\\n^(?:[^a-z]+)$\\n\\n\\nFinally, I'd assuming you want the entire second line, you can do this for the second part:\\n\\n^(.*?(?=[:lower:]).*?)$\\n\\n\\nOr to match your inital version:\\n\\n^(.*?(?=[:lower:])).*?$\\n\\n\\nThe reluctant qualifiers (*?) seemed to be necessary to avoid matching across lines.\\n\\nThe final version I ended up with, thus, is:\\n\\n^(?:[^a-z]+)$\\\\n^(.*?(?=[:lower:]).*?)$\\n\\n\\nThis can be seen in action with your test data <a href=&quot;http://rubular.com/r/xtoVArPzoS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>here. It only captures the line (&quot;3.2 A MEMORY ABSTRACTION: ADDRESS SPACES 177&quot; &quot;#205&quot;).\\n\\nObviously, the regex I've used might be quite specific to Ruby, so testing with your regex engine may be somewhat different.

Looking back at what I wrote, I got a little too involved in breaking-down the regex and missed something about the problem as described. If you modify the regex I gave above to:\\n\\n^(?:[^[:lower:]]+)$\\\\n^(.*?(?=[[:lower:]]).*?)$\\n\\n\\nIt matches only the line (&quot;3.3.1 Paging 187&quot; &quot;#215&quot;), which is the only line with lowercase letters following a line with no lowercase letters, as <a href=&quot;http://rubular.com/r/XDqzubd4ll&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>can be seen here.

Is it going to interact well with other scripts on the page? Don't know... that depends what it's for and what other kinds of scripts you expect it to be combined with. You can never make a ‘plugin’ that won't ever fail when interacting with other plugins and scripts, but by keeping the side-effects to a minimum you can at least try to minimise it.\\n\\nNote that id is not a unique identifier. Although there should be only one element with a given ID in a document at one particular time, (a) multiple elements might be created with the same ID and inserted into the document sequentially (perhaps one element replacing another with the same ID), and (b) people still do use duplicate IDs even though it's wrong. Either would cause your cache to collect old, no-longer-used elements and return them inappropriately.\\n\\nIt is unfortunate that there is no JavaScript function to get a scalar/hashable unique identifier for an arbitrary object; the only way to obtain object identity is to ===-compare against other objects. \\n\\nAnother common way forward is to add an arbitrary new property to the node (‘expando’ in IE terms), with a randomised really-unique ID. Expandos aren't guaranteed by standard to work, but it has worked in all browsers back to day one and is commonly used.\\n\\nThis is how for example jQuery identifies elements uniquely, and if you are writing a plugin for jQuery you might try taking advantage of that—jQuery.expando holds the name of the arbitrary expando property being used for this purpose... or, sticking within the documented featureset, data() could be used to add your own metadata to the element including another unique ID of your own.\\n\\nExpandos do have some unpleasant side-effects including accidentally treating them as attributes in IE&lt;9 (which can't tell the difference between properties and attribute), but if you're using jQuery anyway you probably don't have anything to lose.\\n\\n\\n  is it worth doing for the optimization on my decorator?\\n\\n\\nDepends how many you're expecting to have on a page. Comparing each item to each other item is an O(n²) operation; tolerable (and probably preferable given the side-effects) if n is low, but quickly getting unmanageable as n grows.\\n","owner_user_id":"18936","last_editor_user_id":"NULL","last_editor_display_name":"NULL","last_edit_date":"NULL","last_activity_date":"06/07/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"5","favorite_count":"NULL"}

There is also a third possibility: that your recursion has entered into a loop. For example, in a depth-first search through a graph, if you forget to mark nodes as visited, you'll end up going in circles, revisiting nodes that you have already seen.\\n\\nHow can you determine which of these three situations you are in? Try to make a way to describe the &quot;location&quot; of each recursive call (this will typically involve the function parameters). For instance, if you are writing a graph algorithm where a function calls itself on neighbouring nodes, then the node name or node index is a good description of where the recursive function is. In the top of the recursive function, you can print the description, and then you'll see what the function does, and perhaps you can tell whether it does the right thing or not, or whether it goes in circles. You can also store the descriptions in a HashMap in order to detect whether you have entered a circle.\\n","owner_user_id":"626853","last_editor_user_id":"NULL","last_editor_display_name":"NULL","last_edit_date":"NULL","last_activity_date":"06/07/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"3","favorite_count":"NULL"}

This setting does override the default text displayed when the control shows tool tips for cells that are sized so they cannot completely display their value.\\n\\nTry what I did to see this.  Load a DGV with data that fits within all DGV cells.  Verify that no cell ToolTips are being displayed.  Resize a column so some of a cell's text is not displayed and verify that this cell's value appears in the cell's ToolTip.  Now add the following code to the DGV's CellToolTipTextNeeded event:\\n\\ne.ToolTipText = string.Format(&quot;Hello, I'm on row '{0}', column '{1}'&quot;, e.RowIndex, e.ColumnIndex);\\n\\n\\nRepeat the tests above.  You'll notice that the custom tool tip text is displayed and the default tool tip that displays a resized cell's text is not displayed.\\n\\nAlso keep in mind the CellToolTipTextNeeded event's RowIndex and ColumnIndex properties (demonstrated above); you might find these handy in retrieving the text you'll want for your tool tip text or for determining if you want to display a tool tip at all.\\n\\nUPDATE\\nI worked up an example based on the code you posted.

Anyway, here's a test:\\n\\nauto q = make_array(make_array(make_array(std::string(&quot;Cat1&quot;), std::string(&quot;Dog1&quot;)), make_array(std::string(&quot;Mouse1&quot;), std::string(&quot;Rat1&quot;))),\\n                    make_array(make_array(std::string(&quot;Cat2&quot;), std::string(&quot;Dog2&quot;)), make_array(std::string(&quot;Mouse2&quot;), std::string(&quot;Rat2&quot;))),\\n                    make_array(make_array(std::string(&quot;Cat3&quot;), std::string(&quot;Dog3&quot;)), make_array(std::string(&quot;Mouse3&quot;), std::string(&quot;Rat3&quot;))),\\n                    make_array(make_array(std::string(&quot;Cat4&quot;), std::string(&quot;Dog4&quot;)), make_array(std::string(&quot;Mouse4&quot;), std::string(&quot;Rat4&quot;)))\\n                    );\\n\\nstd::cout &lt;&lt; q &lt;&lt; std::endl;\\n// produces: [[[Cat1, Dog1], [Mouse1, Rat1]], [[Cat2, Dog2], [Mouse2, Rat2]], [[Cat3, Dog3], [Mouse3, Rat3]], [[Cat4, Dog4], [Mouse4, Rat4]]]\\n\\n\\n(For the last output I'm using my <a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4850473/pretty-print-c-stl-containers&quot;>pretty-printer.)\\n\\n\\n\\nActually, let us improve the type safety of this construction. We definitely need all types to be the same. One way is to add a static assertion, which I've edited in above. The other way is to only enable make_array when the types are the same, like so:\\n\\ntemplate &lt;typename T, typename ...Args&gt;\\ntypename std::enable_if&lt;all_same&lt;T, Args...&gt;::value, std::array&lt;T, sizeof...(Args) + 1&gt;&gt;::type\\nmake_array(T &amp;&amp; t, Args &amp;&amp;... args)\\n{\\n  return std::array&lt;T, sizeof...(Args) + 1&gt; { std::forward&lt;T&gt;(t), std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...};\\n}\\n\\n\\nEither way, you will need the variadic all_same&lt;Args...&gt; type trait. Here it is, generalizing from std::is_same&lt;S, T&gt; (note that decaying is important to allow mixing of T, T&amp;, T const &amp; etc.):\\n\\ntemplate &lt;typename ...Args&gt; struct all_same { static const bool value = false; };\\ntemplate &lt;typename S, typename T, typename ...Args&gt; struct all_same&lt;S, T, Args...&gt;\\n{\\n  static const bool value = std::is_same&lt;typename std::decay&lt;S&gt;::type, typename std::decay&lt;T&gt;::type&gt;::value &amp;&amp; all_same&lt;T, Args...&gt;::value;\\n};\\ntemplate &lt;typename S, typename T&gt; struct all_same&lt;S, T&gt;\\n{\\n  static const bool value = std::is_same&lt;typename std::decay&lt;S&gt;::type, typename std::decay&lt;T&gt;::type&gt;::value;\\n};\\ntemplate &lt;typename T&gt; struct all_same&lt;T&gt; { static const bool value = true; };\\n\\n\\nNote that make_array() returns by copy-of-temporary, which the compiler (with sufficient optimisation flags!) is allowed to treat as an rvalue or otherwise optimize away, and std::array is an aggregate type, so the compiler is free to pick the best possible construction method.\\n\\nFinally, note that you cannot avoid copy/move construction when make_array sets up the initializer. So std::array&lt;Foo,2&gt; x{Foo(1), Foo(2)}; has no copy/move, but auto x = make_array(Foo(1), Foo(2)); has two copy/moves as the arguments are forwarded to make_array. I don't think you can improve on that, because you can't pass a variadic initializer list lexically to the helper and deduce type and size -- if the preprocessor had a sizeof... function for variadic arguments, perhaps that could be done, but not within the core language.\\n","owner_user_id":"596781","last_editor_user_id":"596781","last_editor_display_name":"","last_edit_date":"06/08/2011","last_activity_date":"06/08/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"NULL","favorite_count":"NULL"}

So, it's (-5) time zone and date looks right. \\nI load date field into my object using EF and inside object property says it is 22:17 and Kind=Unspecified which is OK again, it is loaded from SQL, I know it is UTC but code doesn't know that so it loads this date as Unspecified.\\nI return this object to WCF client. It can be XML or it can be JSON. Here is what happen. When I JSON(this is what client specifies) - I get this: 1307503021113-0500 for date.

I far as I can see, only viewDidLoad was called.\\n\\nI have 1 section, the number of elements in my array equals 3 (as opposed to nil).\\n\\nRelevant code is here...\\n\\n- (void)viewDidLoad {   \\n    [super viewDidLoad];\\n    FileControl *fileArray = [[FileControl alloc] init];\\n    matArray = [fileArray findUniqueItemsInArray:0 :[fileArray setFileToArray]];\\n    [fileArray release];\\n    NSLog(@&quot;%i \\\\n %@&quot;, [matArray count], matArray); // matArray is filled.\\n    NSLog(@&quot;ViewDidLoad&quot;); }\\n\\n- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {\\n    static NSString *CellIdentifier = @&quot;Cell&quot;;\\n\\n    UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];\\n    if (cell == nil) {\\n        cell = [[[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier] autorelease];\\n    }\\n    NSLog(@&quot;CellForRowAtIndexPath&quot;);\\n\\n    NSString *text = [matArray objectAtIndex:[indexPath row]];\\n    [[cell textLabel] setText:text];\\n\\n    return cell; }\\n\\n@interface MaterialTableViewController : UITableViewController &lt;UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource&gt; {\\n\\n    IBOutlet UITableView *materialTableView;\\n    NSArray *matArray;\\n\\n}\\n\\n@property (nonatomic, retain) NSArray *matArray;\\n\\n@end\\n\\n\\nThe other methods are standard.\\n\\nI guess my problem lies in that I don't completely understand the flow well enough.\\n\\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.\\n","owner_user_id":"700510","last_editor_user_id":"700510","last_editor_display_name":"","last_edit_date":"06/07/2011","last_activity_date":"06/08/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"Table View not populating","tags":["nsarray"],"answer_count":"5","comment_count":"2","favorite_count":"NULL"}

Loading the same view file in two different controllers or methods is perfectly acceptable, indeed it's appropriate. If there are only a few tweaks that need to be made, try to reuse the view file by passing different data to it.\\n\\nIf you want to simply load the form view file in different instances, that would save you some code duplication. Just set different rules and if needed, pass different data to the view. It's similar to using the same form to create and edit something in two different methods. If the output is going to be totally different, just write separate view files. If it's the same output but with different data - definitely reuse it.\\n\\nDon't get obsessed with trying to not duplicate view fragment code - if you are writing even more code to force the reuse of a view file by modifying it for different instances, it kind of defeats the purpose. Try to just make it a general practice to make your code as reusable as possible.\\n\\nSo, without seeing your actual code - I'd say don't worry about it. In my experience, view files for front-end and back-end are almost always unique (completely different UI).

If you use native floating point types, you need to avoid situations where a Very Large Number is added to a very small number: the small number may completely vanish. If you use a custom numerical representation, math will be an order of magnitude slower, which may or may not be a problem depending on how much math your application is doing.\\n\\nAlso, choosing that &quot;common base unit&quot; for comparisons is 1,000 times easier if you know what context you are working in.

The library would either need to choose a default and be less generic, or allow changing the common unit, which would make it much more complicated (and therefore bug prone).\\n\\nSo, while I can't authoritatively answer your question and say no such library exists, that's why I think you haven't found one.\\n","owner_user_id":"10947","last_editor_user_id":"NULL","last_editor_display_name":"NULL","last_edit_date":"NULL","last_activity_date":"06/07/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"NULL","favorite_count":"NULL"}

The intention is that you only have to edit the scaffolding code and you can keep leave boilerplate code untouched. To achieve this I've used \\n\\n\\ninheritance <a href=&quot;https://github.com/Raynos/jQuery-plugin-scaffolding/blob/master/lib/jQuery-plugin-scaffold.js#L210&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>var self = Object.create(Base) Rather then editing the Internal class you have directly you should be editing a sub class.

Use of monkey patching means that the event namespacing is done automatically for you under the hood. This functionality is free and does not come at the cost of readability (calling getEventNS all the time).\\n\\n\\nOO Techniques\\n\\nIt's better to stick to proper JavaScript OO rather then classical OO emulation. To achieve this you should use <a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Object.create. (which ES5 just use the shim to upgrade old browsers).\\n\\nvar Base = (function _Base() {\\n    var self = Object.create({}); \\n    /* ... */\\n    return self;\\n})();\\n\\nvar Wrap = (function _Wrap() {\\n    var self = Object.create(Base);\\n    /* ...  */\\n    return self;\\n})();\\n\\nvar w = Object.create(Wrap);\\n\\n\\nThis is different from the standard new and .prototype based OO people are used to. This approach is preferred because it re-inforces the concept that there are only Objects in JavaScript and it's a prototypical OO approach.\\n\\n[getEventNs]\\n\\nAs mentioned this method has been refactored away by overriding .bind and .unbind to automatically inject namespaces. These methods are overwritten on the private version of jQuery <a href=&quot;https://github.com/Raynos/jQuery-plugin-scaffolding/blob/master/lib/jQuery-plugin-scaffold.js#L229&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>$.sub(). The overwritten methods behave the same way as your namespacing does. It namespaces events uniquely based on plugin and instance of a plugin wrapper around a HTMLElement (Using <a href=&quot;https://github.com/Raynos/jQuery-plugin-scaffolding/blob/master/lib/jQuery-plugin-scaffold.js#L23&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>.ns.\\n\\n[getData]\\n\\nThis method has been replaced with a <a href=&quot;https://github.com/Raynos/jQuery-plugin-scaffolding/blob/master/lib/jQuery-plugin-scaffold.js#L105&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>.data method that has the same API as jQuery.fn.data. The fact that it's the same API makes it easier to use, its basically a thin wrapper around jQuery.fn.data with namespacing. This allows you to set key/value pair data that is immediatley stored for that plugin only. Multiple plugins can use this method in parallel without any conflicts.\\n\\n[publicMethods]\\n\\nThe publicMethods object has been replaced by any method being defined on Wrap being automatically public. You can call any method on a Wrapped object directly but you do not actually have access to the wrapped object.\\n\\n[$.fn[PLUGIN_NAME]]\\n\\nThis has been refactored so it exposes a more standardized API. This api is\\n\\n$(selector).PLUGIN_NAME(&quot;methodName&quot;, {/* object hash */}); // OR\\n$(selector).PLUGIN_NAME({/* object hash */}); // methodName defaults to PLUGIN_NAME\\n\\n\\nthe elements in the selector are automatically wrapped in the Wrap object, the method is called or each selected element from the selector and the return value is always a <a href=&quot;http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>$.Deferred element. \\n\\nThis standardizes the API and the return type. You can then call .then on the returned deferred to get out the actual data you care about. The use of deferred here is very powerful for abstraction away whether the plugin is synchronous or asynchronous.\\n\\n<a href=&quot;https://github.com/Raynos/jQuery-plugin-scaffolding/blob/master/lib/jQuery-plugin-scaffold.js#L55&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>_create\\n\\nA caching create function has been added. This is called to turn a HTMLElement into a Wrapped element and each HTMLElement will only be wrapped once. This caching gives you a solid reduction in memory.\\n\\n<a href=&quot;https://github.com/Raynos/jQuery-plugin-scaffolding/blob/master/lib/jQuery-plugin-scaffold.js#L127&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>$.PLUGIN_NAME\\n\\nAdded another public method for the plugin (A total of two!).\\n\\n$.PLUGIN_NAME(elem, &quot;methodName&quot;, {/* options */});\\n$.PLUGIN_NAME([elem, elem2, ...], &quot;methodName&quot;, {/* options */});\\n$.PLUGIN_NAME(&quot;methodName&quot;, { \\n  elem: elem, /* [elem, elem2, ...] */\\n  cb: function() { /* success callback */ }\\n  /* further options */\\n});\\n\\n\\nAll parameters are optional. elem defaults to &lt;body&gt;, &quot;methodName&quot; defaults to &quot;PLUGIN_NAME&quot; and {/* options */} defaults to {}.\\n\\nThis API is very flexible (with 14 method overloads!) and standard enough to get used to the syntnax for every method your plugin will expose.\\n\\n<a href=&quot;https://github.com/Raynos/jQuery-plugin-scaffolding/blob/master/lib/jQuery-plugin-scaffold.js#L157&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Public exposure\\n\\nThe Wrap, create and $ objects are exposed globally. This will allow advanced plugin users maximum flexibility with your plugin. They can use create and the modified subbed $ in their development and they can also monkey patch Wrap. This allows for i.e. hooking into your plugin methods. All three of these are marked with a _ in front of their name so they are internal and using them breaks the garantuee that your plugin works.\\n\\nThe internal defaults object is also exposed as $.PLUGIN_NAME.global. This allows users to override your defaults and set plugin global defaults. In this plugin setup all hashes past into methods as objects are merged with the defaults, so this allows users to set global defaults for all your methods. \\n\\n<a href=&quot;http://raynos.github.com/jQuery-plugin-scaffolding/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Actual Code\\n\\n(function($, jQuery, window, document, undefined) {\\n    var PLUGIN_NAME = &quot;Identity&quot;;\\n    // default options hash.\\n    var defaults = {\\n        // TODO: Add defaults\\n    };\\n\\n    // -------------------------------\\n    // -------- BOILERPLATE ----------\\n    // -------------------------------\\n\\n    var toString = Object.prototype.toString,\\n        // uid for elements\\n        uuid = 0,\\n        Wrap, Base, create, main;\\n\\n    (function _boilerplate() {\\n        // over-ride bind so it uses a namespace by default\\n        // namespace is PLUGIN_NAME_&lt;uid&gt;\\n        $.fn.bind = function  _bind(type, data, fn, nsKey) {\\n            if (typeof type === &quot;object&quot;) {\\n                for (var key in type) {\\n                    nsKey = key + this.data(PLUGIN_NAME)._ns;\\n                    this.bind(nsKey, data, type[key], fn);\\n                }\\n                return this;\\n            }\\n\\n            nsKey = type + this.data(PLUGIN_NAME)._ns;\\n            return jQuery.fn.bind.call(this, nsKey, data, fn);\\n        };\\n\\n        // override unbind so it uses a namespace by default.\\n        // add new override. .unbind() with 0 arguments unbinds all methods\\n        // for that element for this plugin. i.e. calls .unbind(_ns)\\n        $.fn.unbind = function _unbind(type, fn, nsKey) {\\n            // Handle object literals\\n            if ( typeof type === &quot;object&quot; &amp;&amp; !type.preventDefault ) {\\n                for ( var key in type ) {\\n                    nsKey = key + this.data(PLUGIN_NAME)._ns;\\n                    this.unbind(nsKey, type[key]);\\n                }\\n            } else if (arguments.length === 0) {\\n                return jQuery.fn.unbind.call(this, this.data(PLUGIN_NAME)._ns);\\n            } else {\\n                nsKey = type + this.data(PLUGIN_NAME)._ns;\\n                return jQuery.fn.unbind.call(this, nsKey, fn);    \\n            }\\n            return this;\\n        };\\n\\n        // Creates a new Wrapped element.

I just couldn't figure it out myself.\\n\\nThis is a console app. You'll need a reference to Microsoft.mshtml for the IHTMLDocument2 interface.\\n\\nusing System;\\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices;\\n\\nnamespace ControlInternetExplorerServer\\n{\\n    ////////////////////////\\n    // LOTS OF PINVOKE STUFF\\n    ////////////////////////\\n\\n    [Flags]\\n    public enum SendMessageTimeoutFlags : uint\\n    {\\n        SMTO_NORMAL = 0x0,\\n        SMTO_BLOCK = 0x1,\\n        SMTO_ABORTIFHUNG = 0x2,\\n        SMTO_NOTIMEOUTIFNOTHUNG = 0x8\\n    }\\n\\n    public static class NativeMethods\\n    {\\n        [DllImport(&quot;user32.dll&quot;, CharSet = CharSet.Unicode)]\\n        public static extern IntPtr FindWindow(\\n            string lpClassName,\\n            string lpWindowName);\\n\\n        [DllImport(&quot;user32.dll&quot;, SetLastError = true)]\\n        public static extern IntPtr FindWindowEx(\\n            IntPtr hwndParent,\\n            IntPtr hwndChildAfter,\\n            string lpszClass,\\n            string lpszWindow);\\n\\n        [DllImport(&quot;user32.dll&quot;, CharSet = CharSet.Auto, EntryPoint = &quot;GetWindow&quot;, SetLastError = true)]\\n        public static extern IntPtr GetNextWindow(IntPtr hwnd, [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.U4)] int wFlag);\\n\\n        [DllImport(&quot;oleacc.dll&quot;, PreserveSig = false)]\\n        [return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.Interface)]\\n        public static extern object ObjectFromLresult(\\n            IntPtr lResult,\\n            [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPStruct)] Guid refiid,\\n            IntPtr wParam);\\n\\n        [DllImport(&quot;user32.dll&quot;, SetLastError = true, CharSet = CharSet.Auto)]\\n        public static extern uint RegisterWindowMessage(string lpString);\\n\\n        [DllImport(&quot;user32.dll&quot;, SetLastError = true, CharSet = CharSet.Auto)]\\n        public static extern IntPtr SendMessageTimeout(\\n            IntPtr windowHandle,\\n            uint Msg,\\n            IntPtr wParam,\\n            IntPtr lParam,\\n            SendMessageTimeoutFlags flags,\\n            uint timeout,\\n            out IntPtr result);\\n\\n        public static IntPtr FindWindowRecursive(IntPtr parent, string windowClass, string windowCaption)\\n        {\\n            var found = FindWindowEx(parent, IntPtr.Zero, windowClass, windowCaption);\\n            if (found != IntPtr.Zero)\\n            {\\n                return found;\\n            }\\n\\n            var child = FindWindowEx(parent, IntPtr.Zero, null, null);\\n            while (child != IntPtr.Zero)\\n            {\\n                found = FindWindowRecursive(child, windowClass, windowCaption);\\n                if (found != IntPtr.Zero)\\n                {\\n                    return found;\\n                }\\n                child = GetNextWindow(child, 2);\\n            }\\n            return IntPtr.Zero;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n\\n    //////////////////////\\n    // THE INTERESTING BIT\\n    //////////////////////\\n\\n    public class Program\\n    {\\n        public static void Main(string[] args)\\n        {\\n            // First parameter is the class name of the window type - retrieved from Spy++\\n            // Second parameter is the title of the window, which you'll\\n            // probably want to take in via command line args or something.\\n            var wlwWindow = NativeMethods.FindWindow(&quot;WindowsForms10.Window.8.app.0.33c0d9d&quot;, &quot;Untitled - Windows Live Writer&quot;);\\n            if (wlwWindow == IntPtr.Zero)\\n            {\\n                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Unable to locate WLW window.&quot;);\\n                return;\\n            }\\n\\n            // Since you don't know where in the tree it is, you have to recursively\\n            // search for the IE window.

This is done with a simple piece of jQuery-flavoured javascript:\\n\\n//Cache the important elements to avoid looking them up when we refresh:\\n        var container = $('#container'),\\n            blockContainer = container.find('.blockContainer'),\\n            chatContainer = container.find('.chat'),\\n            chatLog = chatContainer.find('.chatlog');\\n\\n        container.bind('refresh', function(){\\n            //Determine the height of .blockContainer, and give .chat the leftovers\\n            chatContainer.css('top', function(){\\n                return blockContainer.height(); //The 'top' property of the chat corresponds to the bottom of the block container\\n            });\\n\\n        });\\n\\n\\nThis binds a custom event called 'refresh' to the #container element - whenever you need the heights to be re-calculated, you trigger this event like so: container.trigger('refresh') (or $('#container').trigger('refresh') if you don't have the container cached like I have). You can trigger whenever a new chat or block item is added, when the window is resized, when an AJAX load finishes - it's up to you. \\n\\nFeel free to take whatever you like from the example code - the styles there use 'conflicting absolute positions': more on the concept here: <a href=&quot;http://www.alistapart.com/articles/conflictingabsolutepositions/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://www.alistapart.com/articles/conflictingabsolutepositions/\\n\\nThe CSS is not the most well-organised, but it should get you started.

So 3 commits == 3 startups and 3 shutdowns.\\n\\nThere are a few things you can do to improve this:\\n\\n\\nRun the script/runner process in the background so it doesn't slow down your commit. On Linux you can do this by adding an &amp; at the end of the command but I don't remember how to do it on Windows\\nInstead of fetching changesets on each commit you can run it regularly through cron or a scheduled task. The rake task redmine:fetch_changesets is built for this purpose, it will iterate through each project and run fetch_changesets for you.\\nThe command you are running goes through every project and fetches the changes. If you know the project identifier you can change the query so it only gets the changes for the project you are working on:\\n\\nscript\\\\runner &quot;Project.find('your-project').try(:repository).try(:fetch_changesets); Rails.logger.flush&quot;\\n\\nReplace 'your-project' with the project identifier (found in most of the urls in Redmine). The try parts are used to make sure you don't get an empty record.\\nUse the web service to fetch changesets instead of script/runner. The web service will use an existing Ruby process so it should already be loaded and the only slow down will be while Redmine downloads and processes the changes. This can also be used with the first option (i.e. background a web service request).

Switch with a SPAN port next.  However, if you don't have either of those and given that you mentioned that you have a computer with two ports, you could setup bridging between them.  However, it would actually be much easier if you can configure the two electronic devices' IP addresses to setup the desktop as a router.  Specifically, if you're running Linux (or can boot a Linux LiveCD with wireshark on it), you can very easily assign device 1 the IP address 10.0.0.2 with a default gateway of 10.0.0.1 (assuming you can set the devices to use static IP's; if they use DHCP, you'll have to set up a DHCP server on the linux box and that's getting out of scope).  Setup the second device with IP address 10.0.1.2 with default gateway 10.0.1.1.  Setup the linux box so that interface 1 (eth0) has IP 10.0.0.1 and interface 2 (eth1) has IP 10.0.1.1.  Plug all 4 interfaces into the switch (you could also directly connect the devices to each port, but depending on how old the devices are, they might require cross over cables)  Last step is to enable routing; on the linux box as root, do echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward and now the two devices will need to go through the linux router so you can sniff the traffic.\\n","owner_user_id":"755851","last_editor_user_id":"NULL","last_editor_display_name":"NULL","last_edit_date":"NULL","last_activity_date":"06/07/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"NULL","favorite_count":"NULL"}

This is what I got when I ran your code (after removing references to endEvent cuz it couldn't find it). So to fix this, just give it something to draw\\n\\nThe second problem is apparent once you give it something to draw. I manually put in a line of code to draw the Player, for which I used one of my own pngs. When you do this it will fail to compile with a null pointer exception. The reason is because in your GameView class, you have your Graphics object called &quot;graphics&quot; set to null, but then you proceed to call paintComponents(graphics). As mentioned before, this only compiled before because you never actually drew anything. To fix this, you can just remove \\n\\npublic void paintComponents (Graphics g)\\n{\\n\\n    for(Bullet j : GameState.getEnBullets()){\\n        g.drawImage(j.getImage(),j.getX(), j.getY(), null);}\\n    for(Enemy j : GameState.getEnemies()){\\n        g.drawImage(j.getImage(),j.getX(), j.getY(), null);}\\n    for(Bullet j : GameState.getPlayBullets()){\\n        g.drawImage(j.getImage(),j.getX(), j.getY(), null);}\\n    this.paint(g);\\n\\n}\\n\\n\\nand let the overridden paintComponent(Graphics g) method above it do all the work. Additionally, instead of the paintComponents(graphics) calls, use repaint(). Also you can get rid of the first call to paintComponents(graphics) in the constructor as it will paint the first time by default. If you really want to use your own method then you have to create a Graphics object and pass that in. \\n\\nLastly, in the overridden paintComponents(Graphics g) method, you have the last line being to draw the giant black box. This will then cover up anything you've drawn before. So you should have that as the first line and draw everything else in order such that the thing you want to be on top should be drawn last.

If you open a raw TCP socket, you can call the <a href=&quot;http://uk.php.net/manual/en/function.socket-set-blocking.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>socket_set_blocking function on the connection, this means that read / write operations don't block.  You can take several of these connections and write a small amount of data to each of them in a loop, this way you are sending your requests &quot;at once&quot;.\\n\\nThe reason I asked whether you have to wait until the whole message is consumed before the endpoint validates the signature is that even if Curl is sending the requests &quot;all at once&quot;, there's always a possibility that the time it takes to upload will mean that the validation fails.  Presumably it's slower to upload 2000 requests at once than to upload 5, so you'd expect more failures for the former case?  Similarly, if your requests are processing synchronously (i.e. one at a time) then you'll see the same error for the same reason, although in this case it's the later requests that are expected to fail.  Maybe you need to think about the data upload rate required to upload a message of a particular size within a particular time frame, then try and calculate an optimum multi-payload size.  Perhaps the best approach is the simplest: upload one at a time and calculate the signature just before each upload?\\n\\nA better approach might be to put the signature in a message header, this way the signature can be read earlier in the upload process.\\n","owner_user_id":"408003","last_editor_user_id":"NULL","last_editor_display_name":"NULL","last_edit_date":"NULL","last_activity_date":"06/11/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"NULL","favorite_count":"NULL"}

How much content you maintain in the feed is usually based on the type of content you are publishing but as the size of your feed grows it can impact a feed clients ability to retrieve and parse your information.\\n\\nIf you truly want to publish a historical feed that is continually added to but never has content items removed, you may want to consider the following options (based on the needs of your consumers):\\n\\n\\nImplement <a href=&quot;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Feed Paging and Archiving, <a href=&quot;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005#section-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>per RFC 5005 Section 3, as paged feeds can be useful when the number of entries is very large, infinite, or indeterminate.  Clients can &quot;page&quot; through the feed, only accessing a subset of the feed's entries as necessary.\\nLogically segment your content into multiple feeds, and provide <a href=&quot;http://www.rssboard.org/rss-autodiscovery&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>auto-discovery to the feeds on your website.\\nImplement a REST based service interface that allows consumers to retrieve and filter your content as an Atom or RSS formatted feed, with the default representation using some reasonable defaults.\\n\\n\\nOption 1 is a reasonable approach only if you know the type of feed clients that will be consuming your feed, as not all feed clients support pagination.\\n\\nOption 2 is the most common one seen on public facing web sites, as most browsers and clients support auto-discovery, and you can provide both a full historical feed and a smaller more recent content feed (or segment in ways that make sense for your content).\\n\\nOption 3 potentially allows you to provide the benefits of both of the first two options, plus you can provide multiple feed formats and rich filtering of your content. It is a very powerful way to expose feed content, but usually is only worth the effort if your consumers indicate a desire for tailoring the feed content they wish to consume.\\n\\nWhile most rich feed clients will retrieve feed content asynchronously, clients that make synchronous (and potentially frequent) requests for your feed may experience timeout issues as the size of your feed increases.\\n\\nRegardless of what direction you take, consider implementing <a href=&quot;http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2002/10/21/http_conditional_get_for_rss_hackers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Conditional GET on your feeds; and understand the potential consumers of your syndicated content in order to choose the strategy that fits best.

What does this mean exactly? Are they assigning an instance of get_config to $this-&gt;config? I assume the $this-&gt;config comes from a declaration at the top of the file where it says var $config = array();\\n\\nI went looking for the get_config() function, and I found the following line: \\n\\nfunction &amp;get_config($replace = array())\\n\\n\\nHere, my question is pretty much the same: what does the &amp; stand for and what does it do? I see these two things (&amp; and =&amp;) a lot throughout the CI core files.\\n\\nSomething else I was wondering about is their commenting 'style'. Every function starts with a comment block, here's an example:\\n\\n /**\\n * Set HTTP Status Header\\n *\\n * @access  public\\n * @param   int     the status code\\n * @param   string\\n * @return  void\\n */\\n\\n\\nIs this generated by some plugin or library? It sounds like a lot of hassle to do this manually. I haven't checked out stuff like PHPDoc, but could this be something similar (or PHPDoc)? It seems useful, if it generates that automatically? Heehee.\\n\\nOnto the next question. I see different functions prefixed by underscores. There's the obvious __construct but there's also functions like _set_default_controller(); and _set_routing(); Do these underscores have any special meaning? I know the double underscore is used for something called 'magic methods' (I'm thinking about __get and __set since those are the ones I've used myself). Do they have any 'special' technical meaning or is this pure semantics? Enlighten me if possible.\\n\\nLast but not least, in the controller core file I saw this:\\n\\nclass CI_Controller {\\n\\n    private static $instance;\\n\\n    public function __construct()\\n    {\\n        self::$instance =&amp; $this;\\n                // goes on\\n\\n\\nThe line of interest here is self::$instance =&amp; $this; What does this mean? Does it set $thisto an instance of itself (wiiiiiild guess, haha), so we can use $this? Or does that make no sense? Actually it doesn't, since in the very basic MVC boilerplate I use myself for basic websites, I use $this without any of that advanced stuff.\\n\\nCan anyone offer some insight here? I'd be grateful.

But the most important thing is that most techniques that improve this status-quo and lead to better quality code result is runtime problems. And a SQL run time problem is nothing like a suboptimal code construct in code, it results in bad plans that give results in tens and hundreds of times slower than an optimal plan. In other words, when a DRY query definition base don reasonable blocks results in a table scan plan that runs 10 seconds and an ugly single-use view has a better plan that runs in 10 ms, you forget everything about DRY and go with the ugly but fast view. The differences in run time between a good plan and a bad plan are just too big.\\n\\nThis is why with SQL development a good projects ends up with a few well tuned queries that are constantly measured and checked for performance. I'm sad to say but in my experience the more 'healthy' the SQL code was from a classic code pov (DRY, reusable, maintainable) the more problems it had in real world production when faced with large data size. I really wish there was an easy way to deploy reusable SQL blocks that could be assembled into complex structures. It just doesn't work that way. I know enough about how SQL query optimization works to understand that the query optimizers look at the resulted complex block as a whole and they cannot leverage the internal blocks as 'units of work', they are tasked to optimize the final, end result. And optimizing such complex queries, considering data access paths, IO costs, size of data, column values distribution probabilities is just very very very complex, orders of magnitude more complex than the task, say, a C# optimizer is asked to do.\\n\\nMy advice would be: keep few complex views that are tested and tuned.

Your compiler appears to optimize the latter better than the former.\\n\\nNote that in Real Life, you rarely want to initialize such a huge array in one fell swoop. (What use are a bunch of zeroes?  Obviously you intend to put something else in there eventually...  And initializing hundreds of megabytes is very cache-unfriendly.)\\n\\nInstead, you would write something like:\\n\\nconst int size = 200000000;\\nstd::vector&lt;vec2&gt; v;\\nv.reserve(size);\\n\\n\\nThen when you are ready to put a real element into the vector, you use v.push_back(element).  The reserve() allocates memory without initializing it; the push_back() copy-constructs into the reserved space.\\n\\nAlternatively, when you want to put a new element into the vector, you can use v.resize(v.size()+1) and then modify the element v.back().  (This is how a &quot;pool allocator&quot; might work.)  Although this sequence will initialize the element and then overwrite it, it will all happen in the L1 cache, which is almost as fast as not initializing it at all.\\n\\nSo for a fair comparison, try a large vector (with reserve) vs. an array for creating a sequence of non-identical items.

When the browser opens a new connection to the server, what it's doing is creating a socket and then calling connect and send on that socket. When the server gets this incoming connection, it might not care if this is the same client as some previous connection. If does care (e.g. it has logged-in sessions or shopping carts) it has to use cookies or whatnot if to associate this connection with previous ones. (I'm ignoring persistent connections, which are beyond the scope of your question.)\\n\\nBut when the browser receives the response from the server, it does so by calling recv on the same socket that it used to send the request, so it knows which request that response goes with before it even starts reading it. In theoretical terms, the browser is maintaining state information about the connections it has open. In practical terms, it has a list or array of sockets.\\n\\nThe browser also keeps track of which windows and tabs are associated with which sockets. This is how it can update the spinners and status lines to reflect the status of the corresponding connections. And if the user clicks the stop button, it knows which socket (or sockets) to close.\\n\\nSo in your scenario, the user has clicked a link or bookmark in a window or tab associated with an existing socket representing a connection to a server where the server's response hasn't been received yet. The browser can simply close that socket as if the user had clicked the stop button. And even if it didn't close it, the browser knows the user no longer wants to see the response. Meanwhile it opens a new socket to the server the user is interested in.\\n","owner_user_id":"743077","last_editor_user_id":"NULL","last_editor_display_name":"NULL","last_edit_date":"NULL","last_activity_date":"06/08/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"4","favorite_count":"NULL"}

My apologies for misreading the question. I leave my answer here as I believe it has additional value and relevant information for future readers.\\n\\nI also think that this quote from the <a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.emit.opcodes.constrained.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>reference in <a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1249086/boxing-on-structs-when-calling-tostring/1249095#1249095&quot;>Mehrdad's answer is particularly thought provoking:\\n\\n\\n  \\n  If thisType is a value type and\\n  thisType does not implement method\\n  then ptr is dereferenced, boxed, and\\n  passed as the 'this' pointer to the\\n  callvirt  method instruction.\\n  \\n  \\n  This last case can occur only when\\n  method was defined on Object,\\n  ValueType, or Enum and not overridden\\n  by thisType. In this case, the boxing\\n  causes a copy of the original object\\n  to be made. However, because none of\\n  the methods of Object, ValueType, and\\n  Enum modify the state of the object,\\n  this fact cannot be detected.\\n\\n\\nOne cannot, therefore, write a program to demonstrate that the boxing is taking place. It is only discernible by looking at the IL and completely understanding the constrained prefix for the callvirt instruction.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom section 11.3.5 of the C# language specification at <a href=&quot;http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/8/8/388e7205-bc10-4226-b2a8-75351c669b09/CSharp%20Language%20Specification.doc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/8/8/388e7205-bc10-4226-b2a8-75351c669b09/CSharp%20Language%20Specification.doc (<a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa336809.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa336809.aspx):\\n\\nWhen a struct type overrides a virtual method inherited from System.Object (such as Equals, GetHashCode, or ToString), invocation of the virtual method through an instance of the struct type does not cause boxing to occur. This is true even when the struct is used as a type parameter and the invocation occurs through an instance of the type parameter type. For example:\\n\\nusing System;\\nstruct Counter\\n{\\n    int value;\\n    public override string ToString() {\\n    \\tvalue++;\\n    \\treturn value.ToString();\\n    }\\n}\\nclass Program\\n{\\n    static void Test&lt;T&gt;() where T: new() {\\n    \\tT x = new T();\\n    \\tConsole.WriteLine(x.ToString());\\n    \\tConsole.WriteLine(x.ToString());\\n    \\tConsole.WriteLine(x.ToString());\\n    }\\n    static void Main() {\\n    \\tTest&lt;Counter&gt;();\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n\\nThe output of the program is:\\n\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n\\n\\nAlthough it is bad style for ToString to have side effects, the example demonstrates that no boxing occurred for the three invocations of x.ToString().\\n\\nSimilarly, boxing never implicitly occurs when accessing a member on a constrained type parameter. For example, suppose an interface ICounter contains a method Increment which can be used to modify a value. If ICounter is used as a constraint, the implementation of the Increment method is called with a reference to the variable that Increment was called on, never a boxed copy.\\n\\nusing System;\\ninterface ICounter\\n{\\n    void Increment();\\n}\\nstruct Counter: ICounter\\n{\\n    int value;\\n    public override string ToString() {\\n    \\treturn value.ToString();\\n    }\\n    void ICounter.Increment() {\\n    \\tvalue++;\\n    }\\n}\\nclass Program\\n{\\n    static void Test&lt;T&gt;() where T: ICounter, new() {\\n    \\tT x = new T();\\n    \\tConsole.WriteLine(x);\\n    \\tx.Increment();\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t// Modify x\\n    \\tConsole.WriteLine(x);\\n    \\t((ICounter)x).Increment();\\t\\t// Modify boxed copy of x\\n    \\tConsole.WriteLine(x);\\n    }\\n    static void Main() {\\n    \\tTest&lt;Counter&gt;();\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n\\nThe first call to Increment modifies the value in the variable x. This is not equivalent to the second call to Increment, which modifies the value in a boxed copy of x. Thus, the output of the program is:\\n\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n\\n\\nFor further details on boxing and unboxing, see §4.3.\\n","owner_user_id":"10223","last_editor_user_id":"10223","last_editor_display_name":"","last_edit_date":"08/08/2009","last_activity_date":"08/08/2009","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"2","favorite_count":"NULL"}

Instead, they use <a href=&quot;http://www.silverpointdevelopment.com/sptbxlib/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>SpTBX, developed by Silverpoint Development.

(Or use GExperts.)  Some properties and events have changed or gone, which is annoying.

Is the way that humans model things and we're able to solve most of the problems with it.\\n\\nIn theory you can define every aspect of a game, system or whatever using OO. In practice if you do, your program will simply behave too slow so the paradigm is messed up by optimizations which trade the simplicity of the model from performance.\\n\\nIn that way, relational databases are not object oriented so we build an object oriented layer between our code and the database... by doing so you lost some of the performance of the database and some of its expressiveness because, from the point of view of OO paradigm a relational database is a full class, is an very complex object that provides information.\\n\\nFrom my point of view OO is an almost perfect approach in the theoretical sense of the word, as it maps closely to the way we, humans, think, but it doesn't fit well with the limited resources of the computational development... so we take shortcuts. At the and, performance is far more important than theoretical organization or clearness so this shortcuts become standards or usual practices. \\n\\nThat is, we are adapting the theoretical model to our current limitations. In the times of cobol in the late 70's object oriented was simply impossible... it would imply to many aspects and too little performance so we used a simplified approach, so simplified you didn't have objects or class, you had variables ... but the concept was, in that time, the same. Groups of variables described related concepts, properties that today will feet into an object. Control sequences based on a variable value where used to replace class hierarchies and so on.\\n\\nI think we've been using OOP for a long time and that we'll continue using it for a long time. As hardware capabilities improve we'll be able to unsimplify the model so that it becomes more adaptable. If I describe perfectly (almost) the concept of a cat (which involves a lot of describing for a lot of concepts involved) that concept will be able to be reused everywhere... the problem here is not, as I've said, with the paradigm itself but with our limitations to implement it.\\n\\nEDIT: To answer the question about why use pure OO. Every &quot;science&quot; wants to have a complete model to represent things. We have two physic models to describe nature, one at the microscopic level and one for the macroscopic one, and we want to have just one because it simplifies things it provides us with a better way to prove, test and develop things. With OO the same process applies. You can't analytically test and prove a system if the system doesn't follow a precise set of rules. If you are changing between paradigms in a program then your program cannot be properly analized, it has to be disected in each one, analized and then analized again to see that the interactions are correct. It makes a lot more difficult to understand a system because in fact you have two or three system that interact in different ways.\\n","owner_user_id":"2695","last_editor_user_id":"2695","last_editor_display_name":"","last_edit_date":"08/08/2009","last_activity_date":"08/08/2009","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"NULL","favorite_count":"NULL"}

That's not a lot, but what I saw held true for all of us.\\n\\nBoth languages are VERY good and I personally have no preference.  I feel equally comfortable in both, and I really don't think either is superior to the other.\\n\\nBUT just based on what I've seen, when moving to .Net, you're better off starting with C# for one reason only.  .Net development is more about learning and using the class library, not language semantics.  VB6 hides some of this by putting shortcusts into the language spec.\\n\\nWhen you're learning a language that is not similar to what you've already done, you're more likely to look for the &quot;right&quot; way to do things.\\n\\nMicrosoft did a lot to make VB.Net easy for VB6 developers to pick up on, so you can easily code on VB.Net very similarly to what you did in VB6.  This means that it's extremely easy to rely on the &quot;shortcuts&quot; and bring bad habits into your .Net development.  So you see people who don't truly &quot;get&quot; things like the differences in ADO.Net and their programs have bad performance and design issues because of this.  \\n\\nAdded several hours later based on comments\\n\\nI just want to clarify that I am not stating that VB is inferior to C#.  As pointed out, both compile down to the same MSIL, and both languages are good.  What I meant by &quot;VB6'ers bringing in bad habits&quot; can be clarified with an example:\\n\\nTwo of the five I worked with did the same exact thing in code.  They needed to get records from a database and loop through them in order to perform some maniuplation onthe data.  The normal thing to do would be to either use a DataReader or DataAdatpter with a DataTable and loop through that.  However, both of them instead created some array variables and looped through the DataReader results and assigned them to the arrays of arrays, and then looped through the arrays to do their calculations, meaning that they not only added unnecessary computing cycles, they also took items out of a collection that could be accesed with things like \\n\\nDim FullName AS String = CurrentRow(&quot;FirstName&quot;).ToString()  + &quot; &quot; + CurrentRow(&quot;LastName&quot;).ToString()\\n\\n\\nto (assuming that ar is the array variable and i is the indexer)\\n\\n Dim strFullName AS String = ar(i)(3).ToString()  + &quot; &quot; + ar(i)(4).ToString()\\n\\n\\nTheir method worked, but added extra cycles, and made the code harder to understand.  I asked each of them why they did it this way.  One of them had wanted to be able to use the data after the connection was closed so they didn't accidentally update something.  This is something you would need to worry about with a RecordSet, but not with a DataReader or a DataAdapter.  This was clearly someone not grasping the difference between the VB6 way of doing things and ADO.Net.  The other one just felt more comfortable with arrays because she was familiar with them.\\n\\nSo my point had nothing to do with one language being &quot;better&quot; than the other.  That would be arrogance and it would also be uninformed.  Functionally, there is not much you can do in one that you can't do in the other.  And I LIKE some of the VB.Net &quot;shortcuts&quot; I mentioned earlier on.  (VbNewline vs System.Environment.NewLine and the whole My namespace, InputBoxes, etc). \\n\\nMy point was that when learning something completely unfamiliar, you're less likely to get thrown by your own preconceptions.  We saw things like this go away when we switched to a C# shop from a VB.Net shop.  It had NOTHING to do with the language, and EVERYTHING to do with the developers being forced to learn properly instead of taking shortcuts.\\n\\nSo, I still stick by my original advice for this reason, but by all means, if you like VB, go with it.  And don't worry about anyone &quot;looking down&quot; on you for using it.  All of that &quot;my language is better than your language&quot; stuff is nonsense.  Some languages have advantages over others, but in the .Net world, in the VB vs. C# debate, both languages are actually so close that there's not much of a difference.  The debate as pointless (and grown up) as the &quot;my daddy can beat up your daddy&quot; argument.\\n","owner_user_id":"60682","last_editor_user_id":"60682","last_editor_display_name":"","last_edit_date":"08/09/2009","last_activity_date":"08/09/2009","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"4","favorite_count":"NULL"}

What is the best way to accomplish this? Basically, all the solutions I've come up with operate on a &quot;polling&quot; pattern when what I want is an &quot;interrupt&quot; pattern. \\n\\nHere are some possible solutions I've come up with:\\n\\n\\nHave a cronjob fire every minute. The script that fires checks a database to see if there are any emails to send, if there are, it sends them, else it goes back to sleep. Drawback with this is that there is a bit of overhead incurred every minute. Also, this may not be a scalable system, especially when the number of users gets so large that it may take over a minute to send out all the emails.\\nSame as #1, but job only fires every 15 minutes. This is a bit more manageable, but not perfect, as it restricts the users to reminders on the 15 minute marks, and it still incurs a bit of overhead when there are no emails to send. Not bad, but not perfect either.\\nHave PHP exec() a bit of code that dynamically alters crontab or schedules an &quot;at&quot; job in the underlying linux. This would give me the flexibility and &quot;interrupt&quot; type model I so crave, but would open up a huge security hole in allowing PHP to exec() linux code. So, I'm going to go ahead and rule this one out.\\n\\n\\nSo, anything better than what I've come up with? Perhaps a way to schedule email without using cron? I'm very curious to see what you guys have to say about this :).\\n","owner_user_id":"788432","last_editor_user_id":"788432","last_editor_display_name":"","last_edit_date":"06/08/2011","last_activity_date":"06/08/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"Best way to dynamically schedule reminder email?

Retrieving a specific version would involve walking the list looking for a particular version value (for a linked list) or indexing into the array (for an array).  A &quot;rollback&quot; would involve clearing out an entry from the end of the list and freeing the associated string.\\n\\nYou could also use a database (sqlite, for instance), store the information in a table, and let the DB engine handle the adds, deletes, and searches.  This might be overkill, however.\\n\\nI don't really follow your example, though.  I'm assuming the first code block you posted indicates a single input string (that is, a snapshot of what the text data looks like at a particular version)?  If so, multiple &quot;trees&quot; shouldn't be a problem since the input is stored as raw text and not processed or interpreted in any way.  I certainly don't understand your &quot;Unix shell&quot; example.  Can you break that down in more detail?  Specifically, for each line, clearly list what the input is, what the output is, and what you expect the &quot;current version&quot; of the data to look like at that point.\\n\\nUpdate:\\nIgnore my previous comment about rollback; I was thinking of it in terms of how this website uses the term (meaning to revert to a previous state), and you use the term differently (meaning to retrieve an older version).\\n\\nEach snapshot of the entire data set can be represented by a single C string since elements are separated by non-null characters (whitespace and/or curly braces).  A simple data structure like the one I outlined above should give you the capabilities that you need if you create a linked list of them.  Since the data is stored in it's string representation, commit and rollback operations would be as trivial as adding a new element to the list (for commit) or walking the list backwards and passing the string to printf (for rollback).  The 'show' command is a different animal, because it doesn't really have much to do with the way you version the data.  As far as the versioning system is concerned, all you would do is grab the last entry from the list.  The real work there is done by whatever library functions you've created for parsing strings and manipulating data internally.\\n","owner_user_id":"79566","last_editor_user_id":"79566","last_editor_display_name":"","last_edit_date":"06/09/2011","last_activity_date":"06/09/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"4","favorite_count":"NULL"}

It was difficult to isolate what exactly the problem was, but I think it was the file locations that was the problem. You should define\\n\\n  private static String DB_PATH = Environment.getDataDirectory() + &quot;/data/your/app/package/databases/&quot;\\n\\n\\ninstead of \\n\\n  private static String DB_PATH = &quot;/data/data/your/app/domain/databases/&quot;\\n\\n\\nI also changed all database access to writeable as I had read that caused problems, but not sure if that was really the issue.\\n\\nIn terms of your second question, I would say it depends on exactly how much data you have. If it's a lot of data, you're probably better off using a database anyway for performance reasons. There are pitfalls to using the SQLite APIs, such as apostrophes in the fields (make sure you use the convenience methods query, update and insert rather than rawQuery). But I'm sure there are with XML too - I don't think there's any &quot;correct&quot; method more what you are most comfortable with - i.e. do you prefer working with databases or raw XML? If neither, and you're not planning to do major updating or querying, I would use XML, or even JSON, because of the reasons above and what Jodes alludes to.\\n","owner_user_id":"278638","last_editor_user_id":"278638","last_editor_display_name":"","last_edit_date":"08/04/2011","last_activity_date":"08/04/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"2","favorite_count":"NULL"}

To declare a pointer to an array, you need a slightly different syntax: Mesh (*meshptr)[array_size];.  As your structure stands now, meshptr is a pointer to a single Mesh object, not an array.  Attempting to use that pointer like an array will cause problems, as you will be directly accessing the memory following the pointer.  This might explain why moving the pointer to the end of the data structure seems to work.  When you do that, you are corrupting the memory following the structure instead of corrupting the structure members following the pointer.  Most likely, your code corrupted one of the last three fields of the structure and that corruption caused the error you are seeing.  Moving the pointer to the end might cause the error to stop, but it doesn't fix the problem (you are still corrupting memory, which can have any number of unexpected effects).\\n\\nThis is merely speculation based on stupid things that I have done in the past.

There is no Watir in the code you provided, NONE. it's all pure Ruby and a tiny bit of stuff from the OCI8 Gem. A GEM is a standard way that Ruby folks use to distribute code libraries and programs written in the Ruby language. See <a href=&quot;http://docs.rubygems.org/read/book/1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>HERE for more info to better understand what a Gem is and how they are used. \\n\\nWatir is another Ruby gem that is for driving web-browsers, and you might be using it elsewhere in your code, but it doesn't relate to this question or OCI8 other than both of them being Ruby code libraries distributed as Gems.  So lets leave it aside so as to not confuse things.\\n\\nThe behavior you are seeing is how the OCI8 gem works, NOT anything to do with Ruby specifically.  If you want something more elegant, then look into different gems that have been created for doing db access with Ruby, for example ActiveRecord, which was suggested in another answer already.  The OCI8 Gem only returns an array if you have the results feeding into a block like you do in your current code.  Otherwise the results are in an object called a Cursor, and you can use the cursor's fetch_hash method to get fetched data as a Hash. The hash keys are column names.  (see <a href=&quot;http://ruby-oci8.rubyforge.org/en/api_OCI8Cursor.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://ruby-oci8.rubyforge.org/en/api_OCI8Cursor.html)\\n\\nAllow me to strongly recommend that you spend a little time learning a bit more about the Ruby language before you tear much further into your current project. Given the nature of the coding you seem to be doing, I'd advise you to read Brian Marik's book &quot;Everyday Scripting with Ruby&quot;, thats going to give you a lot better understanding of the technology you are using, and you'll understand better when we toss around terms like 'hash' as I just did.\\n\\nIf you will allow a bit of general advice in terms of how you are going about interfacing with your database.  IMHO, you should be taking advantage of the db by constructing a query that returns JUST the data you want, instead of grabbing huge amounts of data and trying to parse through it manually.  It's better use of the resource, uses less memory, takes less time to transfer the info from the db, and no matter how good your parsing code might be, it won't be as good as what the Oracle people wrote.  Let the db do the heavy lifting, that's what it's there for.\\n\\nIf what you are dealing with here is data to drive your testing, or validate results, rather than construct one huge monolithic array, I'd recommend you use a much more modular approach.  Use one global variable such as the EMP_ID of the current user you are testing with or against, and have the test code get query results for just the values needed for each validation, or a small logical group of validations like the parts of an address.  It's a lot easier to build up stuff that way on a case by case basis working as you go, instead of trying to write the whole data retrieval bit in one giant piece that will be a nightmare to maintain.  \\n\\nAs it stands all your test code that is verifying function or validating how the site works is going to be tightly coupled to a big monolithic piece that fetches the data from the db.  that creates a lot of dependencies and makes your test code hard to maintain.  If you deal with things in a more modular way, where each validation step retrieves just the data it needs, then it's a lot easier to expand or modify your test code as the site or database changes.  \\n","owner_user_id":"409820","last_editor_user_id":"409820","last_editor_display_name":"","last_edit_date":"06/09/2011","last_activity_date":"06/09/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"5","favorite_count":"NULL"}

However, I realized this method was too expensive due to multiple opening and closing files. I recalled from my Data structure class when studying B-tree, the cost of accessing external resources is considerable, so I try to avoid as much as I can. \\nSo my alternative solution is to put this loading image routine inside the set up scene function which is called only once. But then I now face another issue, there is no way I delete memory because of the glutMainLoop. \\nWhat can I do in this situation? I'm new to openGL so I really don't know to how to handle this particular problem. Any idea would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\n#include &lt;cstdio&gt; \\n#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;\\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\\n\\n#include &quot;Utility.h&quot;\\n#include &quot;TgaHeader.h&quot;\\n#include &quot;TgaImage.h&quot;\\n\\n#include &lt;GL/glut.h&gt;\\n\\nusing namespace std;\\n\\nTgaImage* image = NULL;\\n\\nvoid setupScene() {\\n    // set color background\\n    glClearColor( 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f );\\n    // load image from file\\n    image = loadTgAFile( &quot;Fire.tga&quot; );\\n}\\n\\nvoid renderScene() {\\n    // clear color\\n    glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT );\\n    // TGA format is 1 byte aligned\\n    glPixelStorei( GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1 );\\n    glRasterPos2i( 0, 0 );\\n    if( image != NULL ) {\\n        glDrawPixels(  \\n            image-&gt;header.width,  \\n            image-&gt;header.height,\\n            image-&gt;format,\\n            GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,\\n            image-&gt;pixels\\n        );\\n    }\\n    glutSwapBuffers();\\n}\\n\\nvoid resizeWindow( int w, int h ) {\\n    if( h == 0 ) {\\n        h = 1;\\n    }\\n    glViewport( 0, 0, w, h );\\n    // reset coordinate before modifying\\n    glMatrixMode( GL_PROJECTION );\\n    glLoadIdentity();\\n    // set the clipping volume\\n    gluOrtho2D( 0.0f, w, 0.0f, h );\\n    // reset to modelview matrix\\n    glMatrixMode( GL_MODELVIEW );\\n    glLoadIdentity();\\n}\\n\\nint main( int argc, char** argv ) {\\n    glutInit( &amp;argc, argv );\\n    glutInitDisplayMode( GLUT_DOUBLE | GLUT_RGB );\\n    glutInitWindowSize( 512, 512 );\\n    glutCreateWindow( &quot;Image&quot; );\\n    // register callback\\n    glutReshapeFunc( resizeWindow );\\n    glutDisplayFunc( renderScene );\\n    // initialize scene\\n    setupScene();\\n    glutMainLoop();\\n    // it will never reach this \\n    delete image;\\n}\\n\\n\\nThanks,\\n","owner_user_id":"398398","last_editor_user_id":"5696","last_editor_display_name":"","last_edit_date":"06/08/2011","last_activity_date":"06/08/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"How to reclaim memory after glutMainLoop is activated?","tags":["c++","opengl","glut"],"answer_count":"2","comment_count":"NULL","favorite_count":"3"}

You can further divide each layer into sublayer and build layered hell like:\\n\\n\\nClient side presentation layer\\nServer side view layer\\nController layer\\nService facade layer\\nService layer\\nDomain objects layer\\nRepository + Factory layer\\nORM layer\\nStored procedure layer\\nDatabase view layer\\nDatabase table layer\\n\\n\\nWTF? That is just example that application can be easily over architected. It can go even worse if you insist that only neighbours can exchange data and if you decide to add special type of objects to be exchanged between layers instead of flowing sing set of objects through multiple layers.\\n\\nAdd layers which you need to make you more comfortable with developing the application and which will do reasonable separation of concerns and maintainability needed for the scale of your application. You can simply do the most simplest application which will be used just few weeks and must be developed as fast as possible. In such case you can do that within few days simply by using ASP.NET web forms and data source controls (or ASP.NET dynamic data). It can be badly extensible but in such situation it is exactly what you need to implement application quickly. Writing layers and doing all the stuff around maintainability and extensibility is reasonable if you need it. Another quick prototyping technique is ASP.NET MVC Scaffolding which can create quick multilayered skeleton of the application which can be further modified.\\n\\n\\nBoth approaches are correct and it only depends on the approach you like. The first is called <a href=&quot;http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html&quot;>active record pattern but it is not used very often with entity framework. The second approach is more popular. You can either use EF directly in some middle class which you called Provider (common name is also Service). This class will do both data access logic and business logic. In more complex applications developers like to somehow wrap EF to separate class following <a href=&quot;http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html&quot;>repository pattern and call the repository either from service or directly from web app. code behind or controller (depending on amount of business logic). Try to do it without repository first. My personal opinion is that people should start to use repository only once they understand EF itself.\\nAgain both approaches are correct. In a simple application it is fully acceptable to create EF model with POCO classes (EFv4.x) and use them in all layers. If you are using ASP.NET MVC you can find that you need special classes as view models to fully represent needs of your individual views. In a more complex application you can have separate objects exposed from a business layer - this is especially used if the business layer is exposed as a remote service (WCF).\\nIt depends how you write these DAL methods - it is <a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3653009/entity-framework-and-connection-pooling/3653392#3653392&quot;>absolutely necessary to not share the EF context among requests! It also depends if you want to write some test or not. Layer defined by static methods is something which goes directly against testable architecture where you want unit test just single layer (unit testing with EF can be hard). It also depends if you want to use dependency injection which is based on instances. \\n\\n","owner_user_id":"413501","last_editor_user_id":"NULL","last_editor_display_name":"NULL","last_edit_date":"NULL","last_activity_date":"06/11/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"NULL","favorite_count":"NULL"}

It will also allow the use of booleans in the expressions, where true is treated as 1 and false 0. allowing the use of boolean logic in expressions.\\n\\npublic static double Evaluate(string expr)\\n    {\\n        expr = expr.ToLower();\\n        expr = expr.Replace(&quot; &quot;, &quot;&quot;);\\n        expr = expr.Replace(&quot;true&quot;, &quot;1&quot;);\\n        expr = expr.Replace(&quot;false&quot;, &quot;0&quot;);\\n\\n        Stack&lt;String&gt; stack = new Stack&lt;String&gt;();\\n\\n        string value = &quot;&quot;;\\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; expr.Length; i++)\\n        {\\n            String s = expr.Substring(i, 1);\\n            // pick up any doublelogical operators first.\\n            if (i &lt; expr.Length - 1)\\n            {\\n                String op = expr.Substring(i, 2);\\n                if (op == &quot;&lt;=&quot; || op == &quot;&gt;=&quot; || op == &quot;==&quot;)\\n                {\\n                    stack.Push(value);\\n                    value = &quot;&quot;;\\n                    stack.Push(op);\\n                    i++;\\n                    continue;\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            char chr = s.ToCharArray()[0];\\n\\n            if (!char.IsDigit(chr) &amp;&amp; chr != '.' &amp;&amp; value != &quot;&quot;)\\n            {\\n                stack.Push(value);\\n                value = &quot;&quot;;\\n            }\\n            if (s.Equals(&quot;(&quot;))\\n            {\\n                string innerExp = &quot;&quot;;\\n                i++; //Fetch Next Character\\n                int bracketCount = 0;\\n                for (; i &lt; expr.Length; i++)\\n                {\\n                    s = expr.Substring(i, 1);\\n\\n                    if (s.Equals(&quot;(&quot;)) bracketCount++;\\n\\n                    if (s.Equals(&quot;)&quot;))\\n                    {\\n                        if (bracketCount == 0) break;\\n                        bracketCount--;\\n                    }\\n                    innerExp += s;\\n                }\\n                stack.Push(Evaluate(innerExp).ToString());\\n            }\\n            else if (s.Equals(&quot;+&quot;) ||\\n                     s.Equals(&quot;-&quot;) ||\\n                     s.Equals(&quot;*&quot;) ||\\n                     s.Equals(&quot;/&quot;) ||\\n                     s.Equals(&quot;&lt;&quot;) ||\\n                     s.Equals(&quot;&gt;&quot;))\\n            {\\n                stack.Push(s);\\n            }\\n            else if (char.IsDigit(chr) || chr == '.')\\n            {\\n                value += s;\\n\\n                if (value.Split('.').Length &gt; 2)\\n                    throw new Exception(&quot;Invalid decimal.&quot;);\\n\\n                if (i == (expr.Length - 1))\\n                    stack.Push(value);\\n\\n            }\\n            else\\n            {\\n                throw new Exception(&quot;Invalid character.&quot;);\\n            }\\n\\n        }\\n        double result = 0;\\n        List&lt;String&gt; list = stack.ToList&lt;String&gt;();\\n        for (int i = list.Count - 2; i &gt;= 0; i--)\\n        {\\n            if (list[i] == &quot;/&quot;)\\n            {\\n                list[i] = (Convert.ToDouble(list[i - 1]) / Convert.ToDouble(list[i + 1])).ToString();\\n                list.RemoveAt(i + 1);\\n                list.RemoveAt(i - 1);\\n                i -= 2;\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        for (int i = list.Count - 2; i &gt;= 0; i--)\\n        {\\n            if (list[i] == &quot;*&quot;)\\n            {\\n                list[i] = (Convert.ToDouble(list[i - 1]) * Convert.ToDouble(list[i + 1])).ToString();\\n                list.RemoveAt(i + 1);\\n                list.RemoveAt(i - 1);\\n                i -= 2;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        for (int i = list.Count - 2; i &gt;= 0; i--)\\n        {\\n            if (list[i] == &quot;+&quot;)\\n            {\\n                list[i] = (Convert.ToDouble(list[i - 1]) + Convert.ToDouble(list[i + 1])).ToString();\\n                list.RemoveAt(i + 1);\\n                list.RemoveAt(i - 1);\\n                i -= 2;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        for (int i = list.Count - 2; i &gt;= 0; i--)\\n        {\\n            if (list[i] == &quot;-&quot;)\\n            {\\n                list[i] = (Convert.ToDouble(list[i - 1]) - Convert.ToDouble(list[i + 1])).ToString();\\n                list.RemoveAt(i + 1);\\n                list.RemoveAt(i - 1);\\n                i -= 2;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        stack.Clear();\\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.Count; i++)\\n        {\\n            stack.Push(list[i]);\\n        }\\n        while (stack.Count &gt;= 3)\\n        {\\n            double right = Convert.ToDouble(stack.Pop());\\n            string op = stack.Pop();\\n            double left = Convert.ToDouble(stack.Pop());\\n\\n            if (op == &quot;&lt;&quot;) result = (left &lt; right) ?

Basicly, some names are defined as dependant (the rules for which are a bit confusing), these names must be looked up when instantiating the template, and independant names must be looked up when parsing the template. This is both hard to implement (apparantly), and confusing for developers, so compilers tend to not implement it to the standard. To answer your question, it looks like Visual C++ delays all lookups, but searches both the template context and the instantiation context, so it accepts a lot of code that the standard says it shouldn't. I'm not sure whether it doesn't accept code it should, or worse, interprets it differently, but it seems possible.\\n","owner_user_id":"20135","last_editor_user_id":"NULL","last_editor_display_name":"NULL","last_edit_date":"NULL","last_activity_date":"06/08/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"2","favorite_count":"NULL"}

The error message when trying to connect to Mysql manually is &quot;blocked because of many connection errors. Unblock with 'mysqladmin flush-hosts'&quot;. Since the database is hosted on an Amazon RDS I don't have the permission to issue this command, but I can reboot the database and once rebooted the website works normally again. Until next time.\\n\\nDrupal reports multiple errors prior to going offline, of two types:\\n\\n\\n  Duplicate entry\\n  &#039;279890-0-all&#039; for key\\n  &#039;PRIMARY&#039; query:\\n  node_access_write_grants /* Guest :\\n  node_access_write_grants */ INSERT\\n  INTO node_access (nid, realm, gid,\\n  grant_view, grant_update,\\n  grant_delete) VALUES (279890,\\n  &#039;all&#039;, 0, 1, 0, 0) in\\n  /var/www/quadplex/drupal-6.20/modules/node/node.module\\n  on line 2267.\\n  \\n  Lock wait timeout exceeded; try\\n  restarting transaction query:\\n  content_write_record /* Guest :\\n  content_write_record */ UPDATE\\n  content_field_rating SET vid = 503621,\\n  nid = 503621, field_rating_value =\\n  1212 WHERE vid = 503621 in\\n  /var/www/quadplex/drupal-6.20/sites/all/modules/cck/content.module\\n  on line 1213.\\n\\n\\nThe nids in these two queries are always the same and refer to two nodes that are frequently automatically updated by a custom module.

But:\\n\\n\\nWhy do these errors occur, and how can they be solved? It seems to me it's to do with several web requests trying to update the same node at the same time. But surely Drupal should deal with this by locking the tables etc? Or should I deal with it in some special way?\\nDespite the higher web load, why does the database completely lock and require to be rebooted? Wouldn't it be better if the website still had access to Mysql and so, once the load is lower, it can serve pages again?

For example, when a shout has been posted to the shoutbox, a filename on the server changes to something, this filename than gets checked (instead of the database), and if the filename is different, than it should load up the shout.  Perhaps, it can even place the shout within the file, instead of the database, and ONLY stick it into the database after another shout has been added to the shoutbox.  Therefore, the last shout will always remain in the file, in text format.\\n\\nWould this be a better approach for handling server overloads?

This seems to be a common format in most books I've looked at.\\n\\nI am using fancy headers.  \\n\\nSo far the best resource I've found is this:\\n\\n<a href=&quot;http://www.markschenk.com/tensegrity/latexexplanation.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://www.markschenk.com/tensegrity/latexexplanation.html\\n\\nThe author suggests the following.  \\n\\n% Code for creating empty pages\\n% No headers on empty pages before new chapter\\n\\\\makeatletter\\n\\\\def\\\\cleardoublepage{\\\\clearpage\\\\if@twoside \\\\ifodd\\\\c@page\\\\else\\n    \\\\hbox{}\\n    \\\\thispagestyle{plain}\\n    \\\\newpage\\n    \\\\if@twocolumn\\\\hbox{}\\\\newpage\\\\fi\\\\fi\\\\fi}\\n\\\\makeatother \\\\clearpage{\\\\pagestyle{plain}\\\\cleardoublepage}\\n\\n\\nThis works just fine if the previous chapter ends on an odd page, it inserts a blank just like I want.  But if the previous chapter ends on an even page, then it simply begins the chapter on the next page(which is odd).\\n\\nI've tried making a few changes to the above, with limited success.  It feels like I am doing a hack to do something that should be fairly easy. But perhaps this is necessary.  \\n\\nAny suggestions?\\n","owner_user_id":"173355","last_editor_user_id":"NULL","last_editor_display_name":"NULL","last_edit_date":"NULL","last_activity_date":"06/08/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"How to have a blank even page before every chapter in Latex","tags":["latex"],"answer_count":"3","comment_count":"NULL","favorite_count":"NULL"}

A program typically should expect arbitrary number of bytes when reading a TCP stream; and the case of 0 byte usually doesn't need special handling.\\n\\nYour program is theoretically wrong. You cannot expect that you can read the entire message at once. One read may return only part of it. Could be just 1 byte. There's no guarantee.\\n\\nThe &quot;righteous&quot; way is to accumulate all bytes read in a buffer. Look for EOT in the buffer.

And it is really not about NIO. Even in traditional blocking TCP IO, this strategy must be done to be theoretically correct.\\n\\nBut, practically, if you do observe that the whole message always come in one piece, you don't need such complication; your original code is practically correct in your environment.\\n\\nNow you observed that sometimes 0 byte is read.

For  runtime dependent classes, I created corresponding  Abstract factories. After following this pattern I end up having too many abstract factories, almost one for each of my class.  \\n\\nIs it common to end up having too many abstract factories when using IOC ? \\n\\nScenario: Suppose I  get an &quot;Entity&quot; object from a database. There are 10 different use cases a user could perform on this entity object. For each of the usecase I have a different class to handle it. In some cases a given use case could have sub use case components which may also need the entity object.\\nAs these classes are dependent on runtime entity object, I had to create abstract factory for each one of them. Finally I wire the construction instructions in the IOC container. \\n\\nIs there an alternative way of doing it. I just feel creating all these factories is waste  of time, ESPECIALLY  when all the sub classes are dependent on the same entity object.  \\n\\nI am inclined on having a single factory / builder class registered for my scenario with IOC container. This factory would create the required  object graph for my scenario. I see IOC as a tool to help implement DI concept.

From the Android documents:\\n\\n\\n  For instance, a view with a\\n  layout_width=&quot;100dp&quot; measures 100\\n  pixels wide on medium-density screen\\n  and the system scales it up to 150\\n  pixels wide on high-density screen, so\\n  that the view occupies approximately\\n  the same physical space on the screen.\\n\\n\\nThe problem that I see is that if I have two devices that are the same resolution, but one is medium density and the other is high density, the high density image would be scaled too big.  \\n\\nDoes that mean that the only option available for guaranteeing that images are the same size regardless of density/resolution is to incorporate conversion functions?

The comments were very valuable, but I feel like I should add some notes for people searching for an answer in the specific context of neural networks.\\n\\nWhen you take the average membrane potential of large assemblies of neurons, like I did, the correlation will be relatively weak. What you want to look at, primarily, is either the correlation between spike trains, the latency or the excitability (i.e. synaptic efficacy) of the individual assemblies. This can be found relatively easily by just looking at points where the potential exceeds a certain threshold. Scipy's correlation function on spike trains will show a much more detailed picture of interdependence between neurons or neural assemblies when you give it spike trains, as opposed to the actual potentials. You can also take a look at Brian's statistics module, which can be found here:\\n\\n<a href=&quot;http://neuralensemble.org/trac/brian/browser/trunk/brian/tools/statistics.py&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://neuralensemble.org/trac/brian/browser/trunk/brian/tools/statistics.py\\n\\nAs for phase difference, it probably is an inadequate measure, because neurons are not harmonic oscillators. If you want to take very precise measurements of phase, it's best to look at the synchronization of inharmonic oscillators. The mathematical model that describes these kinds of oscillators, which is very useful in the context of neurons and neural networks, is the Kuramoto model.

In such a factoring, you can also use &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, and/or &gt;= to divide larger search spaces, improving performance to from O(N) to O(log2N).\\nfor the common simple case of testing a, b, c, and d once, use a macro ala #define ELIF_ABCD(A, B, C, D, F) else if (a == (A) &amp;&amp; b == (B) &amp;&amp; c == (C) &amp;&amp; d == (D)) F();.  Add macros as necessary for other combinations of tests e.g. ABD, ABC, AD.\\n(may make the code more cryptic), but could explore bit-shifting and ORing together the values into a large enough type (int64_t) then e.g. binary search an array of function pointers\\n\\n\\nSomething to look out for though is that the if/else chain may contain things like:\\n\\nif (a == 1 &amp;&amp; c == 3 &amp;&amp; d == 2) functionY();\\nelse if (a == 1 &amp;&amp; b == 2 &amp;&amp; c == 3) function X();\\n\\n\\nHere, the order is significant as an input can match both.

Sometimes increasing the buffer size on the relevant streambuf helps (via streambuf::pubsetbuf).\\n\\nIf this isn't good enough, you might want to try C-style stdio files, eg fopen, fprintf, etc. It takes a little while to get used to the way the text is formatted if you're not used to that method but the performance is usually pretty good.\\n\\nFor the absolute top performance you usually have to go to OS-specific routines. Sometimes the direct low-level file routines are significantly better than the C stdio, but sometimes not - for example, I've seen some people say WriteFile on Win32 is the fastest method on Windows, whereas some Google hits report it as being slower than stdio. Another approach might be a memory-mapped file, eg. mmap + msync - this essentially uses your system memory as the disk and writes the actual data to disk in large blocks, which is likely to be near optimal. However you run the risk of losing all the data if you incur a crash half way for some reason, which may or may not be a problem for you.\\n","owner_user_id":"28875","last_editor_user_id":"NULL","last_editor_display_name":"NULL","last_edit_date":"NULL","last_activity_date":"06/08/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"1","favorite_count":"NULL"}

The operations required on this time value are:\\n\\n\\nSet the value to a time provided by the user, as an &quot;hour&quot; value, a &quot;minute&quot; value, and an &quot;AM/PM&quot; value;\\nOutput the value in the format &quot;11:58 PM&quot;;\\nAdd a minute to the time value.\\n\\n\\nYou now have to decide how you're going to represent the &quot;time&quot; value in C.  One option is to use two integers (representing the hour and the minute) and a boolean (representing AM or PM).  When you use multiple values to represent a single logical value, it's conventional to wrap those into a struct, so our &quot;time&quot; type might look like:\\n\\nstruct time_of_day {\\n    int hour; /* From 1 to 12 */\\n    int minute; /* From 0 to 60 */\\n    int is_pm; /* 0 or 1 */\\n};\\n\\n\\n(In this case we've followed the convention that an int is used to store a boolean value).\\n\\nYou now have to figure out how to implement the three operations above using this representation of a time.  With this representation, the first operation Set the value to a time provided by the user becomes very easy: you simply need to check that the hour and minute values provided are in the correct range, then store them directly in the hour and minute members of the struct time_of_day.  You then need to set the is_pm value to 0 if the user entered &quot;AM&quot;, or 1 if the user entered &quot;PM&quot;.\\n\\nThe second operation Output the value is also quite simple: you can directly use the printf(), if you know these hints:\\n\\n\\nThe printf format specifier %.2d will print an integer padded to two places;\\nThe expression is_pm ? &quot;PM&quot; : &quot;AM&quot; will evaluate to &quot;PM if is_pm is true, and &quot;AM&quot; if it is not.\\n\\n\\nThe third operation, Adding a minute to the time value, can be broken down like this:\\n\\n\\nAdd 1 to the minute part of the time;\\nIf the minute part is now less than 60, stop;\\nSet the minute part to 0 and add 1 to the hour part of the time;\\nIf the hour part is now less than 12, stop;\\nIf the hour part is now 12, change from AM to PM or PM to AM and stop;\\nSet the hour part to 1.\\n\\n\\nAn additional hint for this part:\\n\\n\\nThe expression is_pm = !is_pm will change is_pm from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0.\\n\\n","owner_user_id":"134633","last_editor_user_id":"NULL","last_editor_display_name":"NULL","last_edit_date":"NULL","last_activity_date":"06/08/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"2","favorite_count":"NULL"}

I would highly advise looking at a form-wizard solution if you intend to keep the multi-step signup process though. It will mean the infrastructure takes care of carrying state across requests, and all you need to do is define a series of forms.\\n\\nAnyway, I've opted to simplify your whole process to one step. Using a basic model form, we are able to simply capture ALL of the UserProfile information you need on one page, with very very little code.\\n\\nI've also gone with class-based-views, introduced in Django 1.3. It makes boilerplate code (such as your check at the top of each function for what process you're up to) much nicer to manage, at the cost of more upfront complexity. Once you understand them though, they are fantastic for a lot of use cases. Ok, so; on to the code.\\n\\n# in models.py\\n\\ngraduation_choices = ([(x,str(x)) for x in range(1970,2015)])\\ngraduation_choices.reverse()\\n\\nclass UserProfile(models.Model):\\n    # usually you want null=True if blank=True. blank allows empty forms in admin, but will \\n    # get a database error when trying to save the instance, because null is not allowed\\n    user = models.OneToOneField(User)       # OneToOneField is more explicit\\n    network = models.ForeignKey(Network)\\n    location = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, null=True)\\n    graduation = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, null=True, choices=graduation_choices)\\n    headline = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, null=True)\\n    positions = models.ManyToManyField(Position, blank=True)\\n    avatar = models.ImageField(upload_to='images/%Y/%m/%d', blank=True, null=True)\\n\\n    def get_avatar_path(self):\\n        if self.avatar is None:\\n            return 'images/default_profile_picture.jpg'\\n        return self.avatar.name\\n\\n    def is_complete(self):\\n        &quot;&quot;&quot; Determine if getting started is complete without requiring a field.

Leave the 'which picture to render' up to the template and the model. Also, define a method on the model which can answer the 'completed?' question, rather than defining another field if possible. Makes the process easier.\\n\\n# forms.py\\n\\nclass UserProfileForm(forms.ModelForm):\\n    class Meta:\\n        model = UserProfile\\n        widgets = {\\n            'user': forms.HiddenInput() # initial data MUST be used to assign this\\n        }\\n\\n\\nA simple ModelForm based on the UserProfile object. This will ensure that all fields of the model are exposed to a form, and everything can be saved atomically. This is how I've mainly deviated from your method. Instead of using several forms, just one will do. I think this is a nicer user experience also, especially since there aren't very many fields at all. You can also reuse this exact form for when a user wants to modify their information.\\n\\n# in views.py - using class based views available from django 1.3 onward\\n\\nclass SignupMixin(View):\\n    &quot;&quot;&quot; If included within another view, will validate the user has completed \\n    the getting started page, and redirects to the profile page if incomplete\\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\\n    def dispatch(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\\n        user = request.user\\n        if user.is_authenticated() and not user.get_profile().is_complete()\\n            return HttpResponseRedirect('/profile/')\\n        return super(SignupMixin, self).dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs)\\n\\nclass CheckEmailMixin(View):\\n    &quot;&quot;&quot; If included within another view, will validate the user is active,\\n    and will redirect to the re-send confirmation email URL if not.\\n\\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\\n    def dispatch(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\\n        user = request.user\\n        if user.is_authenticated() and not user.is_active\\n            return HttpResponseRedirect('/confirm/')\\n        return super(CheckEmailMixin, self).dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs)\\n\\nclass UserProfileFormView(FormView, ModelFormMixin):\\n    &quot;&quot;&quot; Responsible for displaying and validating that the form was \\n    saved successfully. Notice that it sets the User automatically within the form &quot;&quot;&quot;\\n\\n    form_class = UserProfileForm\\n    template_name = 'registration/profile.html' # whatever your template is...\\n    success_url = '/home/'\\n\\n    def get_initial(self):\\n        return { 'user': self.request.user }\\n\\nclass HomeView(TemplateView, SignupMixin, CheckEmailMixin):\\n    &quot;&quot;&quot; Simply displays a template, but will redirect to /profile/ or /confirm/\\n    if the user hasn't completed their profile or confirmed their address &quot;&quot;&quot;\\n    template_name = 'home/index.html'\\n\\n\\nThese views will probably be the most complicated part, but I feel are much easier to understand than reams of spaghetti view function code. I've documented the functions briefly inline, so it should make it slightly easier to understand. The only thing left is to wire up your URLs to these view classes.\\n\\n# urls.py\\n\\nurlpatterns = patterns('',\\n\\n    url(r'^home/$', HomeView.as_view(), name='home'),\\n    url(r'^profile/$', UserProfileFormView.as_view(), name='profile'),\\n    url(r'^confirm/$', HomeView.as_view(template_name='checkemail.html'), name='checkemail'),\\n)\\n\\n\\nNow this is all untested code, so it may need tweaks to get working, and to integrate into your particular site. Also, it completely departs from your multi-step process. The multi-step process would be nice in the case of many many many fields.. but a separate page JUST to do the avatar seems a bit extreme to me. Hopefully, whichever way you go, this helps.\\n\\nSome links regarding class based views:\\n\\n<a href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/class-based-views/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>API Reference\\n<a href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/class-based-views/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Topic Introduction\\n\\nI also wanted to mention a few things about your code in general. For instance you have this:\\n\\npopulate_positions = []\\nfor position in positions:\\n    populate_positions.append(Position.objects.get(label=position))\\n\\n\\nWhich could be replaced with this:\\n\\npopulate_positions = Position.objects.filter(label__in=positions)\\n\\n\\nThe former will hit the DB for every position. The latter will do a single query when evaluated.\\n\\nAlso;\\n\\nif request.user.is_authenticated():\\n    username = request.user.username                      \\n    user = User.objects.get(email=username)\\n\\n\\nThe above is redundant. You've got access to the user object already, and then trying to fetch it again.\\n\\nuser = request.user\\n\\n\\nDone.\\n\\nBy the way, if you want to use email addresses as a username, you will have problems. The database will only accept a maximum of 30 characters (it is how the User model is writtin in contrib.auth).

Basically, I'm designing this site with business profiles. The profile table contains all your usual things such as name, uniqueID, address, ect. Now, the whole idea of the site is that it's going to be collecting a small string of informative text. I want to allow the clients to be able to store one per date, with as many as 30 days in advance. The program is only going to show the information from the current date on forward, with expired dates not being shown.\\n\\nThe only way I can really see this being done is a table consisting of the uniqueID, date, and the informative block of text, but this creates pretty extensive queries. Eventually this table is going to be at least 20 times larger than the table of businesses in the first place as these businesses are going to be able to post up to 30 items in this table using their uniqueID. \\n\\nNow, imagine the search page brings up a list of businesses in the area, it's then got to query the new table for all of those ids to get that block of information I want to show based on the date. I'm pretty sure it would be a rather intensive couple of queries just to show a rather simple block of text, but I imagine this is how status updates work for social networking sites in general?

Why?\\n\\n1: When a database gets anywhere near 2 GB or with frequent use, it becomes corrupted in Jet eventually. This has caused us a lot of grief! This has not been fixed in Jet or ACE, though Microsoft has a separate tool that can supposedly fix the database files.\\n\\n2: Microsoft deprecated Jet years ago, in favor of ACE, but if you read the details, Microsoft itself says that ACE is NOT a replacement for jet, and really wants you to use SQL Server instead.\\n\\n3: Jet is no longer a standard part of Windows, but part of Microsoft Office, though you can download and install the distributable. However, you can not have both the 32 and 64-bit engines installed at the same time. If you have Office 2007 32-bit installed, and you try and install the 64-bit ACE engine, it tells you need to uninstall Office 2007 first.\\n\\nSo for these reasons we just decided enough is enough. Installing SQL Server is not a solution because it is a big complex invasive install and not very portable.\\n\\nOur C++ software directly supports SQLite via the sqlite3.c file, and it works very well. I have implemented antive interfaces for OCILIB, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL etc and this was one of the easiest. It is also much faster than Jet and the resulting files maybe a third of the Jet size. We do have some VB6 and VBA and .NET code that also need to use our database files and for that we use the SQLite ODBC driver (just Google it). Works well.\\n\\nSQLite works fine in both 32 and 64-bits. And if you read up on it you will see it is seriously tested and amazingly stable. It also supports more standard SQL and is closer to Oracle/SQL Server than Jet is.\\n","owner_user_id":"448548","last_editor_user_id":"NULL","last_editor_display_name":"NULL","last_edit_date":"NULL","last_activity_date":"06/08/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"3","favorite_count":"NULL"}

It would be more 'standard' to store HTML subtree as a value (and escape all tags) rather than XML subtree. Also beware that some HTML synthax are not always XML compatible ( i.e. &lt;br&gt; vs ,&lt;br/&gt; ). Anyway in practice, you approach is definitely more convenient for editing the xml file.\\n","owner_user_id":"766955","last_editor_user_id":"766955","last_editor_display_name":"","last_edit_date":"06/11/2011","last_activity_date":"06/11/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"4","favorite_count":"NULL"}

The visibility options change how symbols are marked by the compiler (default, hidden, internal).  That information is used by the linker when making shared object elfs (shared libraries).

Each time through, this loop:\\n\\n\\nmakes a copy of strngIndexDefinitionSignature\\ncreates four temporary string objects when concatenating static and dynamic strings\\ncompute strlen(TEXT(&quot;#ClassName#&quot;))\\ncompute strlen(TEXT(&quot;#aIndexArrayName#&quot;))\\nfind start point of both\\nreplace both texts with new texts\\n\\n\\nAnd that's just the first four lines of your loop.\\n\\nCan you replace your strngIndexDefinitionSignature with a format string? I assume it currently looks like this:\\n\\n&quot;flubber #aIndexArrayName# { blubber } #ClassName# blorp&quot;\\n\\n\\nIf you re-write it like this:\\n\\n&quot;flubber a %s%sIndexData { blubber } %s blorp&quot;\\n\\n\\nThen your two find and replace lines can be replaced with:\\n\\nsprintf(out, index_def_sig, sp-&gt;GetObjectName(), fs-&gt;getFrameSetName(),\\n    strngCollectiveArrayClassName);\\n\\n\\nThis would remove two find() operations, two replace() operations, creating and destroying four temporary string objects, a string duplicate that was promptly over-written with two replace() calls, and two strlen() operations that return the same result every time (but aren't actually needed anyway).\\n\\nYou can then output your string with &lt;&lt; as usual. Or, you can change sprintf(3) to fprintf(3), and avoid even the temporary C string.\\n","owner_user_id":"377270","last_editor_user_id":"NULL","last_editor_display_name":"NULL","last_edit_date":"NULL","last_activity_date":"06/08/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"7","favorite_count":"NULL"}

It looks like you are doing a between query on a field that is storing a date in Oracle. The problem is that to_char is looking for a variable, not a string. And the act of escaping a variable in rails turns it into a string. So, in this particular case you might convert :alpha and :omega into the format of the value stored in field. That way you can escape field in a straightforward manner. Of course there is the issue with Oracle treating dates as Time. I'm guessing that is why you converted to day-of-year for the compare. If you are using the Oracle Enhanced Adaptor you can set\\n\\nself.emulate_dates_by_column_name = true\\n\\n\\nto make sure that the field is treated like a date. Then use the to_date function(which takes a string) with :alpha and :omega\\n\\nscope :upcoming, lambda { |field| \\n  where(&quot;:field BETWEEN to_date(:alpha,'yyyy/mm/dd') AND to_date(:omega,'yyyy/mm/dd')&quot;,\\n    field: field,\\n    alpha: Time.now.advance(days: 4).strftime('%Y/%m/%d'),\\n    omega: Time.now.advance(days: 8).strftime('%Y/%m/%d'),\\n  )\\n}\\n\\n\\nI have no way of testing this so I might be off in the weeds here.\\n\\nValidating user input as per Jordan is always a good idea.\\n","owner_user_id":"667987","last_editor_user_id":"667987","last_editor_display_name":"","last_edit_date":"06/08/2011","last_activity_date":"06/08/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"1","favorite_count":"NULL"}

First, you must realise that Haskell uses a thing called a <a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk_%28functional_programming%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>thunk for its values. A thunk is basically a value that has not yet been computed yet -- think of it as a function of 0 arguments. Whenever Haskell wants to, it can evaluate (or partly-evaluate) the thunk, turning it in to a real value. If it only partly evaluates a thunk, then the resulting value will have more thunks in it.\\n\\nFor example, consider the expression:\\n\\n(2 + 3, 4)\\n\\n\\nIn an ordinary language, this value would be stored in memory as (5, 4), but in Haskell, it is stored as (&lt;thunk 2 + 3&gt;, 4). If you ask for the second element of that tuple, it will tell you &quot;4&quot;, without ever adding 2 and 3 together. Only if you ask for the first element of that tuple will it evaluate the thunk, and realise that it is 5.\\n\\nWith fibs, it's a bit more complicated, because it's recursive, but we can use the same idea. Because fibs takes no arguments, Haskell will permanently store any list elements that have been discovered -- that is important.\\n\\nfibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)\\n\\n\\nIt helps to visualise Haskell's current knowledge of three expressions: fibs, tail fibs and zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs). We shall assume Haskell starts out knowing the following:\\n\\nfibs                         = 0 : 1 : &lt;thunk&gt;\\ntail fibs                    = 1 : &lt;thunk&gt;\\nzipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs) = &lt;thunk&gt;\\n\\n\\nNote that the 2nd row is just the first one shifted left, and the 3rd row is the first two rows summed.\\n\\nAsk for take 2 fibs and you'll get [0, 1]. Haskell doesn't need to further evaluate the above to find this out.\\n\\nAsk for take 3 fibs and Haskell will get the 0 and 1, and then realise that it needs to partly evaluate the thunk. In order to fully evaluate zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs), it needs to sum the first two rows -- it can't fully do that, but it can begin to sum the first two rows:\\n\\nfibs                         = 0 : 1 : 1: &lt;thunk&gt;\\ntail fibs                    = 1 : 1 : &lt;thunk&gt;\\nzipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs) = 1 : &lt;thunk&gt;\\n\\n\\nNote that I filled in the &quot;1&quot; in the 3rd row, and it automatically appeared in the first and second rows as well, since all three rows are sharing the same thunk (think of it like a pointer that got written to). And because it didn't finish evaluating, it created a new thunk containing the rest of the list, should that ever be needed.\\n\\nI isn't needed, though, because take 3 fibs is done: [0, 1, 1]. But now, say you ask for take 50 fibs; Haskell already remembers the 0, 1 and 1. But it needs to keep going. So it continues summing the first two rows:\\n\\nfibs                         = 0 : 1 : 1 : 2 : &lt;thunk&gt;\\ntail fibs                    = 1 : 1 : 2 : &lt;thunk&gt;\\nzipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs) = 1 : 2 : &lt;thunk&gt;\\n\\n\\n...\\n\\nfibs                         = 0 : 1 : 1 : 2 : 3 : &lt;thunk&gt;\\ntail fibs                    = 1 : 1 : 2 : 3 : &lt;thunk&gt;\\nzipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs) = 1 : 2 : 3 : &lt;thunk&gt;\\n\\n\\nAnd so on, until it has filled in 48 columns of the 3rd row, and thus has worked out the first 50 numbers. Haskell evaluates just as much as it needs, and leaves the infinite &quot;rest&quot; of the sequence as a thunk object in case it ever needs any more.\\n\\nNote that if you subsequently ask for take 25 fibs, Haskell will not evaluate it again -- it will just take the first 25 numbers from the list it has already calculated.\\n","owner_user_id":"368821","last_editor_user_id":"NULL","last_editor_display_name":"NULL","last_edit_date":"NULL","last_activity_date":"06/08/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"1","favorite_count":"NULL"}

I don't recall the actual wording used on DreamWeaver but there's one view with a designer and the other with HTML code.\\n\\nFor example, if you create a textbox on the form, the code behind it will be something like this:\\n\\n&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;txtEmployeeID&quot; /&gt;\\n\\n\\nNow, if you want to print some variable from within the code, you could include it in the code view like this:\\n\\n&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;txtEmployeeID&quot; value=&quot;&lt;?php echo $EmployeeID; ?&gt;&quot; /&gt;\\n\\n\\nYou can actually incorporate PHP code within the html page simply by enclosing the code within the php tags like above.\\n\\nBut this is only a very elementary example.

Your graph distance function is instructive here, because it seems like it should work, so think about where the incremental part should be: The starting point is a distance of 0 from a node to itself, otherwise one greater than the minimum distance among its own immediate neighbors. Thus, we would expect each distance value to be incremental, which means we need them to be suitably corecursive themselves.\\n\\nThe recursion at issue, then, is occurring due to the combination of (+) and minimum: when finding the minimum, 1 will always be less than 1 + n, without needing to worry about what n is... but there's no way to compare Ints without computing the entire value.\\n\\nIn short, the algorithm expects to be able to compare how many times (1 +) was applied to 0 only as far as needed; that is to say, it wants lazy natural numbers defined using &quot;zero&quot; and &quot;successor&quot;.\\n\\nBehold:\\n\\ndata Nat = Z | S Nat\\n\\nnatToInt :: Nat -&gt; Int\\nnatToInt Z = 0\\nnatToInt (S n) = 1 + natToInt n\\n\\ninstance Show Nat where show = show . natToInt\\n\\ninstance Eq Nat where\\n    Z == Z = True\\n    (S n1) == (S n2) = n1 == n2\\n    _ == _ = False\\n\\n    Z /= Z = False\\n    (S n1) /= (S n2) = n1 /= n2\\n    _ /= _ = True\\n\\n\\ninstance Ord Nat where\\n    compare Z Z = EQ\\n    compare Z (S _) = LT\\n    compare (S _) Z = GT\\n    compare (S n1) (S n2) = compare n1 n2\\n\\n\\nAnd then in GHCi:\\n\\n&gt; distance 1 $ fromList [(0,[1]),(1,[0,2]),(2,[1,3]),(3,[2])]\\nfromList [(0,1),(1,0),(2,1),(3,2)]\\n\\n\\nProof that your algorithm works[0]; your implementation of it was just incorrect.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, as a slight variation, let's apply your algorithm to a different graph:\\n\\n&gt; distance 1 $ fromList [(0,[1]),(1,[0]),(2,[3]),(3,[2])]\\n\\n\\n...what do we expect this to do? What is the distance from node 1 for nodes 2 or 3?\\n\\nRunning it in GHCi has the obvious result:\\n\\nfromList [(0,1),(1,0),(2,^CInterrupted.\\n\\n\\nNevertheless, the algorithm works correctly on this graph. Can you see the problem? Why did it hang in GHCi?\\n\\n\\n\\nIn summary, you need to clearly distinguish between two forms that can't be mixed freely:\\n\\n\\nLazy, possibly infinite data, generated corecursively\\nFinite data, consumed recursively\\n\\n\\nBoth forms can be transformed in a structure-agnostic way (e.g., map works on finite and infinite lists both). Codata can be consumed incrementally, driven by a corecursive algorithm; data can be generated recursively, limited by a recursive algorithm.\\n\\nWhat you can't do is consume codata recursively (e.g., left folding an infinite list) or generate data corecursively (rare in Haskell, due to laziness).\\n\\n[0]: Actually, it will fail on some inputs (e.g., some disconnected graphs), but that's a different issue.\\n","owner_user_id":"157360","last_editor_user_id":"157360","last_editor_display_name":"","last_edit_date":"06/08/2011","last_activity_date":"06/08/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"2","favorite_count":"NULL"}

Firstly, the named list object you create on the stack inside your function is copied to a nameless temporary object that holds the return value of the function. Then the temporary object is copied to the final recipient object in the calling code. Most compilers will be able to eliminate one of these copyings (to eliminate the intermediate temporary, as allowed by C++98 specification). \\n\\nTo eliminate the second one the compiler has to be able to perform so called Named Return Value Optimization (as allowed by C++03 specification). A compiler that supports Named Return Value Optimization should be able to essentially implicitly convert your function's interface into the equivalent of the above &quot;return parameter&quot; idiom.

I'm assuming you are seeking some sort of performance boost from using multiple threads? \\n\\nIf you are trying to get a performance gain, there are two things working against you. In the above code, the UI updating is being done by a single thread. No matter how many threads you have sending messages to the myGUIUpdateHandler, only one message is being processed at a time. This may cause tons and tons of invalidates, but your entire scene is being redrawn. Second, you can only ever have one thread modifying Android UI elements.

In fact, I don't know if its possible to do so even using the opengl based views, since i think opengl also depends on a looper concept.\\n\\nMy answer would be that it is not possible, unless you care to clarify why you need two threads so that I can try to form an alternative solution.\\n","owner_user_id":"223440","last_editor_user_id":"NULL","last_editor_display_name":"NULL","last_edit_date":"NULL","last_activity_date":"06/08/2011","community_owned_date":"NULL","closed_date":"NULL","title":"NULL","tags":"NULL","answer_count":"NULL","comment_count":"3","favorite_count":"NULL"}

Basically, the key is to get a matrix of some kind, and manipulate it based off of some input, in the case of this example, the touch/drag of a user. The below code doesn't function perfectly, but it shows the key commands and classes required to perform dragging. For more details, see the linked article.\\n\\nMatrix matrix = new Matrix();\\nsavedMatrix.set(matrix);\\nmatrix.postTranslate(event.getX() - start.x)\\nImageView view = (Some image view here)\\nview.setImageMatrix(matrix);\\n\\n\\nThe next part is to somehow use the accelerometer to get input. I'm going to leave it to you how to best put the two together. My source of this information is <a href=&quot;http://www.hascode.com/2010/04/sensor-fun-using-the-accelerometer-on-android/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>this article. There are a few basic steps.\\n\\nThe first step is to register the listener, and is done by this code.\\n\\nSensorManager  sensorManager = (SensorManager) getSystemService(Context.SENSOR_SERVICE);\\nSensor sensor = sensorManager.getSensorList(Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER).get(0);\\n\\n\\nThe next step is to register a sensor listener. The last bit is to show what the sensor listener looks like. Note that there are 3 outputs of the accelerometer, one for each x, y, and z coordinates.\\n\\n@Override\\nprotected void onResume() {\\n    super.onResume();\\n    sensorManager.registerListener(accelerationListener, sensor,\\n            SensorManager.SENSOR_DELAY_GAME);\\n}\\n\\n@Override\\nprotected void onStop() {\\n    sensorManager.unregisterListener(accelerationListener);\\n    super.onStop();\\n}\\n\\nprivate SensorEventListener accelerationListener = new SensorEventListener() {\\n    @Override\\n    public void onAccuracyChanged(Sensor sensor, int acc) {\\n    }\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public void onSensorChanged(SensorEvent event) {\\n        x = event.values[0];\\n        y = event.values[1];\\n        z = event.values[2];\\n    }\\n\\n};\\n\\n\\nYour next step will be to figure out what the x, y, and z values are for your desired application. I suggest you take and log each of these out using a Log.v(TAG,...) statement. Play around with tilting it, and figure out exactly what you want to do. Tune it until it has the right level of sensitivity, by seeing how far off it is from straight up and down, and having some kind of a rate of changing the x and y coordinates of the image.
