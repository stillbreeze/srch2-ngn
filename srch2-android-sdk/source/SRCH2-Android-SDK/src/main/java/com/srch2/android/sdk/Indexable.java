/**
 * Represents an index in the SRCH2 search server. For every index to be searched on, users of the
 * SRCH2 Android SDK should implement a separate subclass instance of this class. This class contains
 * methods for performing CRUD actions on the index such as insertion and searching. Note that it is
 * always possible to retrieve a reference to a specific {@code Indexable} from the static method
 * {@link com.srch2.android.sdk.SRCH2Engine#getIndex(String)}  where {@code 
 * indexName} matches the return value of {@link #getIndexName()}.
 * <br><br>
 * Each {@code Indexable } instance should be registered prior to calling
 * {@link com.srch2.android.sdk.SRCH2Engine#onResume(android.content.Context)} by calling
 * {@link com.srch2.android.sdk.SRCH2Engine#setIndexables(Indexable, Indexable...)} and passing in all
 * {@code Indexable } instances.
 * <br><br>
 * For each implementation of this class, it is necessary to override the two methods:<br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{@link #getIndexName()} (index's handle) <br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{@link #getSchema()} (configuration of the index)
 * <br><br>
 * In addition, each implementation can customize search results from the index this {@code Indexable} represents by
 * optionally overriding the methods:
 * <br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{@link #getTopK()} (number of search results) <br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{@link #getFuzzinessSimilarityThreshold()} (number of typos per search input) <br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{@link #getHighlighter()} (formatting of search results)
 * <br><br>
 * If the following callback methods are overridden, they will be executed after their corresponding CRUD action:
 * <br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{@link #onInsertComplete(int, int, String)}<br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{@link #onUpdateComplete(int, int, int, String)}<br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{@link #onDeleteComplete(int, int, String)}<br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{@link #onGetRecordComplete(boolean, org.json.JSONObject, String)}<br><br>
 * For example, after calling {@link #insert(org.json.JSONArray)}, once the SRCH2 search server is finished processing
 * the insert, the callback method {@link #onInsertComplete(int, int, String)} will be executed passing the number
 * of successful and failed inserts. Each of these methods includes as its last parameter the exact JSON response
 * as it was returned by the SRCH2 search server detailing the completion status of the operation.
 * <br><br>
 * When the SRCH2 search server comes online, after {@link SRCH2Engine#onResume(android.content.Context)} is called,
 * it will load the indexes into memory. When the particular index the {@code Indexable } represents is initialized
 * and ready for access, the following callback method will be executed:<br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{@link #onIndexReady()}<br><br>
 * There is also one method to return the number of records in the index:<br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{@link #getRecordCount()}.<br>
 * <br>
 * Note that if the index is to be based on an SQLite database, the {@link com.srch2.android.sdk.SQLiteIndexable} class
 * should be used instead.
