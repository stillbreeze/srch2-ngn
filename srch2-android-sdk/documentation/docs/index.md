
##Overview

The SRCH2 Android SDK is a tool for programmers to easily develop an
Android application that supports powerful search on mobile devices.
The SDK is utilizing a search engine written in C++ ground up
to deliver superior features with high performance. The following
figure illustrates how this SDK works.

<center>![SRCH2 Android SDK Overview][overview]</center>

The SDK has a search server that working in the background. The user can operate on
the *Indexable* interface to build and search the indexed data. The search
result can be obtained from the *SearchResultsListener* interface asynchronously. The user can
also talk to the *SRCH2Engine* interface to control the lifecycle of the
background service.

The SDK supports the following search features:

- Full-text search;
- Instant search (prefix predicates);
- Error correction (fuzzy search);
- Phrase search (e.g., "new york");
- Rich data types (e.g., text, int, float, and date);
- Attribute-based search (e.g., "cameron" in a "director" attribute);
- Sorting (e.g., "price < 20");
- Multiple languages;
- Multiple data sources;
- Token-based authorization;
- Complex geo-search;
- Server-side highlighting;
- SQLite connector.

This tutorial will show you how to:

1. Incorporate the SDK into Android Studio projects;
2. Create indexes and insert records;
3. Enable powerful search in your app and display the results on the UI.

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with [Android
Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html).
You should also have an Android device (not an emulator) to run these
instructions. The Android OS version should be at least 4.0 (called
"Ice Cream Sandwich"). This application is set to compile with
Android SDK version 20. In case you have not updated your Android SDK
build and platforms tools to include this version, you should do so
first.

##Quick Start

(1) Clone the tutorial application project from our [Github
repository](https://github.com/SRCH2/hello-srch2-android-sdk):

```
 shell> git clone https://github.com/SRCH2/hello-srch2-android-sdk.git
```

(2) Open Android Studio. From the 'File' menu option (or the 'Quick
Start' menu), select 'Import Project', and choose the root folder of
the cloned project: 

<center>![Opening the cloned Hello SRCH2 Android SDK application project][tutorial-010]</center>

(3) Connect an Android device to your computer. From the 'Run' menu
option, select 'Run demo-basic'.

(4) Once the app has launched, enter characters in the text input
field. You should instantly see search results. The app is doing
instant search on a few dozen movie records. The following are 
screenshots after this step:

<center>![The SRCH2 Android SDK in action!][tutorial-011]</center>

Congratulations! You're now using the SRCH2 Android SDK to power
searches in an Android project.

The rest of this tutorial explains how this SDK works and how to use
it for your projects.

##Installing SDK
 
We first show how to install the SDK using the built-in
[Gradle build system](http://www.gradle.org/). Suppose we have an
existing Android project in Android Studio and we want to incorporate
the SDK. We need to add the SRCH2 server Maven repository to the 
project as follows: 

(1) We want to configure the Gradle build script to include the SRCH2
 Maven server repository. To do so, on the left panel of Android
 Studio, click the top-level 'build.gradle' file of the project. Add the
 following line to the *buildscript.repositories* node and the
 *allprojects.buildscript* node,

```
 maven { url 'http://srch2.com/repo/maven' }
```

as shown in the following figure:

<center>![Including the SRCH2 server Maven repository in the top-level build.gradle file][tutorial-012] </center>

(2) Next we need to add the SDK into the dependencies of
the project. To do so, on the left panel, click 'app', then click
'build.gradle'. On the right panel, add the following line into the
*dependencies* node:

```
 compile group: 'com.srch2', name: 'srch2-android-sdk', version: '0.2.2', ext:'aar'
```

The following is a screenshot:

<center>![Including the SRCH2-Android-SDK.aar file as a dependency in the app module's build.gradle file][tutorial-013]</center>

Notice that this tutorial assumes the SDK version is 0.2.2, which
could be different from the latest version. Please make sure to get
the latest SDK version from the [release page](releases.md) and update
the version number accordingly.

(3) At the top of the editor window, you should be notified that
Gradle needs to be synchronized. Click 'Sync Now' to refresh the
Gradle build system to include these changes, as shown in the
following figure:

<center>![Synchronizing the Gradle build system to include the new dependency][tutorial-014]</center>

To verify if the SDK has been incorporated into your project, open the
*SearchActivity* class file and type in a *SRCH2Engine* method called
*isUserAnAnteaterInATree()* (as a dummy function). If the editor can
show this function automatically, it means you've successfully
installed the SDK, as shown in the following figure: 

<center>![Confirming the SRCH2 Android SDK is integrated into the application][tutorial-015]</center>

Next we will go through several steps to create an index on a data set
to support powerful search.

##Creating Index

An index is created as a subclass of
*Indexable*. For example, the
following declaration defines an index called *MovieIndex*
for the movie data set: 

```
public class MovieIndex extends Indexable {
}
```

Each index needs to implement two abstract methods called
*getIndexName()* and *getSchema()*, shown in the following example:

```
public class MovieIndex extends Indexable {
    
  public static final String INDEX_NAME = "movies";

  public static final String INDEX_FIELD_PRIMARY_KEY = "id";
  public static final String INDEX_FIELD_TITLE = "title";
  public static final String INDEX_FIELD_YEAR = "year";
  public static final String INDEX_FIELD_GENRE = "genre";

  @Override
  public String getIndexName() {
    return INDEX_NAME;
  }

  @Override
  public Schema getSchema() {
    PrimaryKeyField primaryKey = Field.createDefaultPrimaryKeyField(INDEX_FIELD_PRIMARY_KEY);
    Field title = Field.createSearchableField(INDEX_FIELD_TITLE, 3);
    Field year = Field.createRefiningField(INDEX_FIELD_YEAR, Field.Type.INTEGER);
    Field genre = Field.createSearchableField(INDEX_FIELD_GENRE);
    return Schema.createSchema(primaryKey, title, year, genre)
  }
}
```

The *getIndexName()* function returns the name of the index. The
*getSchema()* function returns a *Schema* object, which includes a
list of fields with their types. The values returned for these two
methods should *never* change. 

Whenever a schema is defined in the *getSchema()* function, it must
contain a primary key field. The value of this field should
be unique for each record in the index. In addition to the primary
key, there are three other fields related to movies: two fields that are searchable and one
that is refining. A "searchable" field has textual data that will be
searched in a query. A "refining" field is for storing data values that can be used
for filtering and post-processing. For instance, we can use the
"year" refining attribute to specify a predicate "year > 2005" on
search results, or use it to sort the results. The values of refining and searchable
fields can be retrieved from the results returned by
the server. *Field* objects can be obtained by the
static factory method of the *Field* class.  

For a searchable field, an additional parameter can be passed as
the field's boost value, which is a relevance number that can be used in the ranking function
to compute the relevance of each answer. Its default value is 1.
In our running example, the boost value of the field *title* is set to be 3, while
the value for the field *genre* is the default value 1. Check 
[this page](http://srch2.com/documentation/ranking) for more
information about how the engine ranks results.

A *Schema* instance is obtained by the static factory method of the
*Schema* class. The order of arguments is important when creating a
default *Schema* object: the first parameter is *always* the primary
key, and the subsequent parameters are the rest of the fields, in no
particular order. 

Next we show how to form records to be inserted in the movie
index. The following method generates a *JSONArray* instance
consistent with the schema:

```
public class MovieIndex extends Indexable {

  ...
	
  public static JSONArray getAFewRecordsToInsert() {
    JSONArray jsonRecordsToInsert = new JSONArray();
    try {
      JSONObject record = new JSONObject();
      record.put(INDEX_FIELD_PRIMARY_KEY, "1");
      record.put(INDEX_FIELD_TITLE, "The Good, the Bad And the Ugly");
      record.put(INDEX_FIELD_YEAR, 1966);
      record.put(INDEX_FIELD_GENRE, "Western Adventure");
      jsonRecordsToInsert.put(record);

      record = new JSONObject();
      record.put(INDEX_FIELD_PRIMARY_KEY, "2");
      record.put(INDEX_FIELD_TITLE, "Citizen Kane");
      record.put(INDEX_FIELD_YEAR, 1941);
      record.put(INDEX_FIELD_GENRE, "Mystery Drama");
      jsonRecordsToInsert.put(record);

      record = new JSONObject();
      record.put(INDEX_FIELD_PRIMARY_KEY, "3");
      record.put(INDEX_FIELD_TITLE, "大红灯笼高高挂 (Raise the Red Lantern)");
      record.put(INDEX_FIELD_YEAR, 1991);
      record.put(INDEX_FIELD_GENRE, "Drama");
      jsonRecordsToInsert.put(record);
			
	    ...
			
    } catch (JSONException oops) {
      // We know there are no errors.
    }
    return jsonRecordsToInsert;
  }
}
```

The SDK accepts a *JSONObject* or a *JSONArray* of *JSONObject*s when
inserting or updating records. Each *JSONObject* should contain as its key the 
set of fields as defined in the schema. 

Insertions and updates are invoked by calling
*insert()* and *update()* of the *Indexable* object, respectively.
For example, we can call the following method to insert those records
to the index:

```
  insert(getAFewRecordsToInsert());
```

##Checking Index Status

The *Indexable* class contains a set of methods that can be overridden to
get the result of operations performed on indexes.

Overriding these methods looks like:

```
public class MovieIndex extends Indexable {

  ...
	 
  @Override
  public void onInsertComplete(int success, int failed, String JSONResponse) {
    super.onInsertComplete(success, failed, JSONResponse);
  }

  @Override
  public void onUpdateComplete(int success, int upserts, int failed, String JSONResponse) {
    super.onUpdateComplete(success, upserts, failed, JSONResponse);
  }

  @Override
  public void onDeleteComplete(int success, int failed, String JSONResponse) {
    super.onDeleteComplete(success, failed, JSONResponse);
  }

  @Override
  public void onGetRecordComplete(boolean success, JSONObject record, String JSONResponse) {
    super.onGetRecordComplete(success, record, JSONResponse);
  }

  @Override
  public void onIndexReady() {
    super.onIndexReady();

    if (getRecordCount() == 0) {
      insert(getAFewRecordsToInsert());
    } else {
      // Do any necessary updates...
    }
  }
  
  ...
	
}
```

The first four methods *onInsertComplete*, *onUpdateComplete*,
*onDeleteComplete* and *onGetRecordComplete* will be executed 
whenever its corresponding action is complete (for instance *onInsertComplete* 
will trigger after the SRCH2 search server completes inserting a record in 
response to *insert(getAFewRecordsToInsert())*). The parameters 
of these methods always contain the raw JSON response (*JSONResponse*) as it was 
returned by the SRCH2 server for inspection in case of a failure to
complete the requested action. For inserts, updates and deletes the 
parameters before this indicate the number of records that were either 
successful or failed in completing the action. Note that
*onUpdateComplete* also contains *int upserts* which counts
the number of records that were inserted instead of updated.
Therefore for *onUpdateComplete* the total success count would be *success* + *upserts*. 
The method 
*onGetRecordComplete* contains the parameters *success* and *record* 
where *success* will indicate if the record was retrieved and 
*record* will be that record if retrieved; if not retrieved it will not be
null but contain no keys or values. 

The last method *onIndexReady* will be called as soon as the SRCH2 server is 
up and running and has loaded the index this *Indexable* represents. The
user can use this callback to check the status of the current loaded index,
such as the record number inside the index. For example:

```
  if (getRecordCount() == 0) {
    insert(getAFewRecordsToInsert());
  } else {
    // Do any necessary updates...
  }
```
We simply check whether there are any existing records. The very first time
this callback method is called there will be zero records in the index, then
the records from *getAFewRecordsToInsert()* are inserted. 

##Sending Queries

We can call the *Indexable.search(String searchInput)* to search on a
specific index. For example, the following function call searches for
movie records that match the keywords "beaty ame":

```
  movieIndex.search("beaty ame");
```

The SDK also provides a function *SRCH2Engine.searchAllIndexes()*
that can return results from all indexes registered using the
*SRCH2Engine.setIndexables()* function. 

By default, the engine uses the space delimiter to tokenize the string to multiple keywords 
("beaty" and "ame"). It treats the last keyword ("ame") as a prefix condition,
and other keywords (e.g., "beaty) as complete keywords. The engine
supports fuzzy search by allowing one typo for every three characters
in a keyword. 

The SDK allows you to have more control on the prefix and the fuzziness setting by using the
*Indexable.advancedSearch()* method. 
Please check the [Advanced page](advanced.md) for more details.

##Getting Results

The SRCH2 server passes search result information back to the *SRCH2Engine*
class through the asynchronous callback method *onNewSearchResults(...)* for 
the implementation of the interface *SearchResultsListener*.

This method will be executed by background threads and by default the callback 
*onNewSearchResults(...)* will also be executed from a background thread. In order
to update the user interface of your application, the search results
must be passed to the UI thread. This can be done by implementing your own handler
on the UI thread and posting messages, or calling *runOnUiThread* from an *Activity* from
within the *onNewSearchResults* callback method. However, this default behaviour can be 
overridden by registering the *SearchResultsListener* to callback to the UI thread by 
calling:
```
SRCH2Engine.onResume(mContext, mSearchResultsListener, true);
```
 Here we assume you are familiar with
how an
[*android.widget.BaseAdapter*](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/BaseAdapter.html)
works to populate an
[*android.widget.ListView*](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListView.html). 

In the source code of this tutorial, there is a class called *SearchResultsAdapter* that
extends *BaseAdapter*. Since we'll register the *SearchResultsListener* to callback to the 
UI thread we'll have the *SearchResultsAdapter* implement *SearchResultsListener*:

```
public class SearchResultsAdapter extends BaseAdapter implements SearchResultsListener {

  ...

  @Override
  public void onNewSearchResults(int HTTPresponseCode,
                                     String JSONresponse,
                                       HashMap<String, ArrayList<JSONObject>> resultMap) {
    if (HTTPresponseCode == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK) {
      ArrayList<MovieSearchResult> newResults = new ArrayList<MovieSearchResult>();

      ArrayList<JSONObject> movieResults = resultMap
            .get(MovieIndex.INDEX_NAME);
      if (movieResults != null && movieResults.size() > 0) {
        for (JSONObject jsonObject : movieResults) {
          MovieSearchResult searchResult = null;
          try {
		    JSONObject originalRecord = 
							jsonObject.getJSONObject(Indexable.SEARCH_RESULT_JSON_KEY_RECORD);
            searchResult = new MovieSearchResult(
                                    originalRecord 
                                            .getString(MovieIndex.INDEX_FIELD_TITLE),
                                    originalRecord
                                            .getString(MovieIndex.INDEX_FIELD_GENRE),
                                    originalRecord
                                            .getInt(MovieIndex.INDEX_FIELD_YEAR));
          } catch (JSONException oops) {
            continue;
          }
          if (searchResult != null) {
            newResults.add(searchResult);
          }
        }
      }
    
	  if (newResults.size() > 0) {
		updateDisplayedSearchResults(newResults);
	  } else {
        clearDisplayedSearchResults();
      }
    }
  }
  
}
```

Any time one of the search methods of the API is called (such as
*search()*), *onNewSearchResults()* will be
triggered when the search results are returned from the SRCH2 server.
Its parameters are:

1. *HTTPResponseCode*: indicates how the RESTful action was handled
2. *JSONResponse*: the raw JSON literal as returned by the SRCH2 search 
server containing the set of search results
3. *resultMap*: a mapping of index names to their corresponding results parsed from the
*JSONResponse* literal

The *resultMap* will never be null: if there were no results for any of
the indexes you've defined, the corresponding values for
*ArrayList<JSONObject>* will be of size zero. 

Each *ArrayList<JSONObject>* will contain a set of records that were
returned as the search results. This JSONObject contains the original record in the index, 
which can be obtained by 

```
  jsonObject.getJSONObject(Indexable.SEARCH_RESULT_JSON_KEY_RECORD);
```

In addition, if we set up the highlight field, the search results will also contain the 
highlight information. Please read the [Highlighting section](advanced.md#highlighting) for 
more details.

The next step is to update the ListView of the SearchResultsAdapter by calling 
updateDisplayedSearchResults() and passing the search results or clearing the list if
there were no search results.
  
##Completing Lifecycle

The two *SRCH2Engine* lifecycle methods are *SRCH2Engine.onResume()* and 
*SRCH2Engine.onPause()*. For every call to *SRCH2Engine.onResume()* it is *imperative* 
that the complementary call to *SRCH2Engine.onPause()* is made in order to let the SRCH2 server stop, 
so that it does not take up the device's resources or leak references.

The call to *SRCH2Engine.onResume()* must be preceded by the calls to register any
*Indexable* or *SQLiteIndexable* instances. These methods are *SRCH2Engine.setIndexables()*
and *SRCH2Engine.setSQLiteIndexables()*. If no instances of *Indexable* or *SQLiteIndexable*
are set the *SRCH2Engine* will not start and output an error message to the logcat. When
calling *SRCH2Engine.onResume()* it also necessary to register the *SearchResultsListener* so
there is a method overload of the *onResume()* function that takes an instance of the
*SearchResultsListener* as a parameter--which we saw earlier when registering the *SearchResultsListener*
to call back to the UI thread.

The calls to *SRCH2Engine.onResume()* and *SRCH2Engine.onPause()* should typically be placed
in the *Activity* lifecycle callbacks of the same name. The following code shows how to setup 
the *SRCH2Engine* in the corresponding methods of the lifecycle of the Android application:

```
public class SearchActivity extends Activity implements
        InstantSearchEditText.SearchInputEnteredObserver {

  private MovieIndex mMovieIndex;

  private ListView mSearchResultsListView; 
  private SearchResultsAdapter mSearchResultsAdapter;

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    setContentView(R.layout.activity_search);
    mSearchResultsListView = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.lv_search_results);
    mSearchResultsAdapter = new SearchResultsAdapter(this);
    mSearchResultsListView.setAdapter(mSearchResultsAdapter);

    mMovieIndex = new MovieIndex();
  }
	
  @Override
  protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();
    SRCH2Engine.setIndexables(mMovieIndex);
    SRCH2Engine.onResume(this, mSearchResultsAdapter, true);
  }

  @Override
  protected void onPause() {
    super.onPause();
    SRCH2Engine.onPause(this);
  }
	
  @Override
  public void onNewSearchInput(String newSearchText) {
    SRCH2Engine.searchAllIndexes(newSearchText);
  }

  @Override
  public void onNewSearchInputIsBlank() {
    SRCH2Engine.searchAllIndexes("");
    mSearchResultsAdapter.clearDisplayedSearchResults();
  }
}
```

The *SearchActivity* implements the nested interface
*InstantSearchEditText.SearchInputEnteredObserver*, which is a subclass of *EditText* to capture
character-by-character input. Feel free to reuse this
[code](https://github.com/SRCH2/hello-srch2-android-sdk/tree/master/Hello-SRCH2-Android-SDK/app/src/main/java/com/srch2/android/demo/helloworld)
in your own projects. It's two methods *onNewSearchInput* and *onNewSearchInputIsBlank* are used to pass search input from the user to
the *SRCH2Engine* or clear the list if the user has cleared the search input text; we pass a blank string when the search input is blank
to notify the *SRCH2Engine* to clear the cached last query.

Whenever the SRCH2 server does a search, the results come back instantly. It
is recommended that, while developing with the SDK, you employ
optimizations for displaying data in a *ListView* as quickly as
possible, such as the ViewHolder pattern, lazy loading of bitmaps if you
incorporate icons, et cetera. 

##Next Steps

This tutorial shows how to use the SRCH2 Android SDK to do powerful search on 
an application. Play around with the project, try updating a record,
deleting a record, adding a record with searchable data to appreciate the power of SRCH2's search
capability, and this is only the beginning! 

Please read on in [Advanced Topics](advanced.md) to learn how to form
powerful queries (such as filtering the search results for the *MovieIndex* by
interval of year), or how to set up the SDK for Proguard, or how to manually
interact with the running search server. Search on!
