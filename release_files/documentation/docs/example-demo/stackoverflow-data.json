I want to store each new version of the test data in our subversion repository.</p><p>I&#39ve done some experiments, checking in the last few versions of the data.zip and looking at what happens to the size of the repository.  The uncompressed data is about 150MB, compressed and zipped it&#39s ~50MB.  Each new version of the data.zip file checked into the repository increases the repository&#39s size by about 50MB.  I think it should only increase by the amount of a delta which I expect to be much less.</p><p>Subversion uses xdelta to store compressed difference data.   My attempt to confirm that SVN could do better was to download xdelta and check there isn&#39t much difference between two versions.  Indeed</p><pre><code>xdelta3.0z.x86-64.exe -e -s v1_pathE&#39\\\\&#39data.zip v2_pathE&#39\\\\&#39data.zip v1v2_delta.file</code></pre><p>produced a v1v2_delta.file which was about 3MB.</p><p>I&#39ve looked in the SVN repository at [myrepo]E&#39\\\\&#39dbE&#39\\\\&#39revs and can see large files for each new revision</p><pre><code>02/08/2011  11:12        57,853,082 418902/08/2011  11:40        51,713,289 419002/08/2011  11:46        52,286,060 4191</code></pre><p>(The 4189, 4190 and 4191 are the names of files.)</p><p>I even tried zipping the data.zip without compression.  This didn&#39t make a difference to what SVN stores - from the look of it, my guess is that it is storing a compressed copy of the entire data.zip for every revision, not just the first.  I&#39m running SVN 1.6 with an FSFS backend.</p><p>There are various other good stackoverflow answers about committing binaries and how SVN stores deltas, e.g. <a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/127692/svn-performance-after-many-revisions&quot;>SVN performance after many revisions</a>. But I cannot see from these why deltas aren&#39t being stored in the above case - ie. if xdelta can get such a small diff running standalone, surely SVN can too - or is it choosing not to?!</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> I&#39ve also tried tar (uncompressed) files, again SVN isn&#39t storing them efficiently.  Also I found that we have a zip file of the same data format (although much smaller) in a different repository where SVN <em>has just stored diffs</em>.  </p><p>So the summarized version of this question is: SVN can efficiently store binary files, e.g. <a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/538643/how-good-is-subversion-at-storing-lots-of-binary-files/548454#548454&quot;>10 slightly different CAD files are just 1.2 times the size of 1</a>.  SVN even can be space efficient with compressed zip files sometimes.  But evidently it isn&#39t always space efficient with binary files - under what conditions is this the case?</p>","owner_user_id":"277208","last_editor_user_id":"277208","last_editor_display_name":"","last_edit_date":"08/03/2011","last_activity_date":"04/22/2012","community_owned_date":"01/01/1970","closed_date":"01/01/1970","title":"Inexplicable SVN repository size increase from small differences to big files","tags":["svn","delta"],"answer_count":4,"comment_count":1,"favorite_count":0,"author_name":"Jon Stafford","votes_count":3},
