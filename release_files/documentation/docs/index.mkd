##Overview

SRCH2 is a search engine written in C++ ground up.  By utilizing advanced indexing structures and algorithms,
it delivers superior features with high performance.  It runs on both servers as well as mobile devices.  

The following figure illustrates how to use the engine in an application.  We provide a configuration 
file that specifies parameters for the engine, such as socket a port number, a data source (a JSON file,
MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, Oracle, or MongoDB) and ranking-related values.

SRCH2 provides a RESTful API, using which a client can insert/delete/update records, 
submit search queries, and send control messages such as getting status information, 
saving indexes to the disk, and shutting down the engine gracefully.  The engine returns the results in
the [JSON](http://json.org/) format.

##Features

- Full-text search
- Instant search (prefix predicates)
- Error correction (fuzzy search)
- Boolean expressions
- Faceted search
- Stemming and stop words
- Phrase search (e.g., "new york")
- Rich data types (e.g., text, int, float, and date)
- Attribute-based search
- Filtering (e.g., "price < 20")
- Sorting
- Geo search
- User feedback ranking
- Proximity ranking
- Server-side highlighting
- Query logging
- Configurable ranking (including prefix and fuzzy predicates)
- Real-time updates
- Multi-threaded
- Multiple languages
- Chinese tokenization
- Multiple data sources
- RESTful API
- Support of control messages (e.g., system status and index serialization)
- Port-level network security
- Token-based authorization
- Access control (record based and attribute based)
- Connectors to MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, Oracle, MongoDB, with connectors for other data sources coming soon
- SDK for programmers to write connectors for new data sources.

##What's new in SRCH2 4.4.4
####Features:
- Added a [connector SDK](./connectors/#6-data-connector-sdk) to allow programmers to write customized connectors.
- Added an [Oracle connector](./connectors/#64-an-example-connector-for-oracle).

####Improvements:
- Bug fixes

##Platforms

The SRCH2 engine runs on 64-bit Linux (with a kernel version >= 2.6.32), Mac OS (10.5 and above, Intel x86), 
and Android devices (ARM architecture).  The engine supports all [Unicode characters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters) encoded using [UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).

The rest of the documentation illustrates how to set up a simple SRCH2 instance. We'll take you through 
the basic steps required to download SRCH2, index data, configure search features, and run 
the search server. Enjoy!
